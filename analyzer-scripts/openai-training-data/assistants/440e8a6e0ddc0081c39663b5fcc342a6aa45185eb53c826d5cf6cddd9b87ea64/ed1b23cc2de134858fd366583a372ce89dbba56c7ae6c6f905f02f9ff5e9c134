{"Explain what the SSH data shows in the context of the attack.": "The SSH data shows that there are no unique SSH handshakes (HASSH) or SSH versions recorded for this attack. This could mean that SSH was not used, or the SSH fingerprinting data was not captured during the attack. If SSH was used as part of the login process, we lack the specific details about the client's SSH software and its behavior pattern, which would otherwise be provided by such information."}
