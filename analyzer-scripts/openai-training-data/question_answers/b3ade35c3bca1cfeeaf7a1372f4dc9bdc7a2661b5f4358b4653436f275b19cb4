{"What are the IP addresses and ports involved in the attack?": "The attack involved the following IP addresses and ports:\n\n- Source IP: `91.92.251.103`\n- Source Ports: `36574`, `44494`, `58640`, `48304`, `41420`, `42226`, `48332`, `49896`, `38270`, `33622`, `41974`, `36728`, `58552`, `54436`, `35896`, `44536`, `33434`, `60038`, `59472`.\n\n- Destination IP: `172.31.5.68`\n- Destination Port: `2222` (used across multiple connections). \n\nThe consistent use of destination port `2222` suggests that the honeypot may have been configured to listen on this port, possibly as a substitute for the default SSH port (`22`). The source ports are variable, which is typical for outgoing connections."}
