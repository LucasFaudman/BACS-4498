{"Explain what the SSH data shows in the context of the attack.": "The SSH data associated with the attack reveals that:\n\n- The SSH HASSH (a unique fingerprint for SSH clients and servers) identifier is `a7a87fbe86774c2e40cc4a7ea2ab1b3c`. This HASSH was consistently used across connections, suggesting that the same SSH client software was used for each attempt.\n\n- The SSH version reported is `SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.8.2`. This indicates that the attacker was using the `libssh2` library version `1.8.2`, a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol. \n\nThis consistent use of a single SSH client version and HASSH across multiple connections shows a systematic approach to accessing the system over SSH. The HASSH can potentially be used to identify the attack pattern or the client software used in the attack within network traffic, but it also implies that the attacker did not attempt to vary their SSH fingerprint to evade detection."}
