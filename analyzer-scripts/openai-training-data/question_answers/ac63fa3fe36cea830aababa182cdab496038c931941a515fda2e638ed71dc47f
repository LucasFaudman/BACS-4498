{"Summarize the critical findings from the OSINT sources.": "The critical findings from the OSINT sources regarding the IP addresses involved in the attack are as follows:\n\n### IP Address: `218.92.0.60`\n- **Geolocation:** Nanjing, China\n- **Network Information:**\n  - Part of China's state-operated telecom provider CHINANET's network in Jiangsu province.\n  - Associated with ASN AS4134 and operating on the network range 218.92.0.0/16.\n- **Attacker Profile:**\n  - Reported for malicious activity and botnet behavior, with a 48% risk score from AbuseIPDB.\n  - Listed on multiple blocklists for attacker activity and abuse.\n- **Threat Reporting:**\n  - Detected targeting 24 different honeypots across 154 reports on ISC.\n  - Found in 9 threat pulse feeds on AlienVault OTX and on a high-risk list by MetaDefender.\n- **Security Risks:** The presence on several blocklists and the history in threat reports suggest a compromised or maliciously operated host.\n\n### IP Address: `43.198.99.93`\n- **Geolocation:** Hosted on Amazon EC2 in Hong Kong.\n- **Network Information:**\n  - Linked to Amazon's cloud infrastructure with hosting under the domain amazonaws.com.\n  - Associated with ASN AS16509 in Amazon's network services.\n- **Attacker Profile:**\n  - Shown as a relatively lower risk (9%) according to AbuseIPDB, likely owing to its association with a reputable cloud provider.\n- **Threat Reporting:**\n  - Involved in a significant volume of reports (4568) that target a single honeypot on ISC on a specific day, indicating a substantial activity spike or a concerted attack effort.\n- **Hosting Services:**\n  - Running several services open to the internet, including SSH (Port 22), nginx web server (Port 80), and MySQL database (Port 3306).\n\nIn conclusion, while the IP `218.92.0.60` shows a consistent pattern of malicious activity and risks associated with it, `43.198.99.93`\u2014although it's involved in a large number of reports\u2014may have been either compromised or utilized as part of a temporary attack infrastructure due to its cloud-based nature. Both IPs should be treated with scrutiny in network security contexts, and their reported activities signal the use of diverse infrastructure in conducting attacks, including potential botnets and compromised cloud resources."}
