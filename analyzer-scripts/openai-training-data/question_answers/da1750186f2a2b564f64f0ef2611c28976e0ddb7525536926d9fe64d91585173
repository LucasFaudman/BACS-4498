{"Summarize attack details, methods and goals to begin the report.": "# Executive Summary of Attack\n\n## Attack Details\nThroughout the course of the observed attack, multiple reconnaissance commands were executed from the source IP address `91.92.251.103` targeting a honeypot with the intent to gather information about the system's architecture, running processes, and resources.\n\nThe commands used were indicative of an attacker in the information-gathering phase, with no direct evidence of a specific vulnerability being exploited. The consistent use of SSH from the attacking IP with a unique HASSH (`a7a87fbe86774c2e40cc4a7ea2ab1b3c`) and version (`SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.8.2`) suggests a systematic and potentially automated approach focused on profiling the system.\n\nThe destination port used for the attack was `2222`, indicating that the attacker may have been attempting to exploit a service running on this non-standard SSH port.\n\n## Methods\nThe methods employed in the attack are consistent with an initial reconnaissance and probing stage of the Cyber Kill Chain:\n\n1. **System Profiling**: Gathering hardware and system information using commands like `uname -a` and `cat /proc/cpuinfo`.\n2. **Resource Discovery**: Checking available system resources with `free -m`.\n3. **Service Enumeration**: Listing running processes via `ps -x`.\n4. **Virtualization Detection**: Searching for evidence of a virtualized environment using `dmesg | grep irtual`.\n5. **SSH Fingerprinting**: Establishing SSH connections to determine the SSH version and client fingerprint.\n\nOSINT sources identified the IP as being associated with malicious activities, flagged in various threat intelligence feeds, and implicated the IP in scanning and brute-force activities, particularly involving SSH services.\n\n## Goals\nThe goals of the attack appear to be focused on the following:\n\n- **Gathering Intelligence**: The attacker is likely attempting to compile information in preparation for further, more targeted attacks.\n- **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: The collected data could be used to pinpoint weaknesses for future exploitation.\n- **Preparing for Secondary Actions**: Information such as system specifications and running services could be groundwork for designing specific attacks like resource exhaustion or privilege escalation.\n\nThe honeypot nature of the target implies that the attacker may not have breached an actual production system. Nevertheless, the attack pattern can offer insights into the attacker's capabilities and methods.\n\n---\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that these findings are based on the observed evidence and may not fully encapsulate the assailant's intentions or capabilities, especially in the absence of more overtly malicious activities such as malware deployment or data exfiltration."}
