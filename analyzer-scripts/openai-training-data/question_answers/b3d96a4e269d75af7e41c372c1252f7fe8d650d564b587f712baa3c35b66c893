{"Summarize what is known about the IP addresses involved in the attack using Shodan data.": "The Shodan data provides the following information about the IP addresses involved in the attack:\n\n### IP Address: `218.92.0.60`\n- **Shodan Data:**\n  - The IP is located in Nanjing, China.\n  - It is part of the network operated by CHINANET in Jiangsu province.\n  - The network is identified as CHINANET-BACKBONE.\n  - The Autonomous System Number (ASN) is AS4134.\n  - An exposed service on port 1080 is running OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.10.\n\nThe data from Shodan outlines that the IP address is associated with an organizational network in China and reveals an outdated OpenSSH service, which could indicate that the system might be compromised.\n\n### IP Address: `43.198.99.93`\n- **Shodan Data:**\n  - The IP is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance hosted in Hong Kong.\n  - It is under the domain amazonaws.com.\n  - The cloud service is identified, providing details about the provider (Amazon), region (ap-east-1), and service type (EC2).\n  - The organization listed is Amazon.com, Inc., with ASN AS16509.\n  - Open services include:\n    - Port 22 running OpenSSH 8.0, indicating an SSH service.\n    - Port 80 running nginx 1.24.0, indicating a web server.\n    - Port 3306 running MySQL 8.0.20, indicating a database service.\n\nThe Shodan data for this IP address suggests that it is likely a resource on the Amazon Cloud, with several services available that could potentially be exploited for attacks or could be the result of a previous compromise.\n\nIn summary, Shodan outlines that while one IP appears as part of the traditional network infrastructure in China, the other is part of the modern cloud ecosystem. Both present services that can be points of interest for security assessments or may relate to the infrastructure used for launching or controlling the attack on the honeypot."}
