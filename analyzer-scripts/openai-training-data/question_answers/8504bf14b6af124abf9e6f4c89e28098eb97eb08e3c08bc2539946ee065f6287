{"What are the indicators of compromise (IOCs) for this attack?": "Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this attack, based on the conducted reconnaissance activities and information gathered from various OSINT sources, may include:\n\n1. **Source IP Address**: `91.92.251.103` \u2013 The initiating IP address for the reconnaissance activity which has been reported in various threat intelligence feeds.\n\n2. **SSH Fingerprint (HASSH)**: `a7a87fbe86774c2e40cc4a7ea2ab1b3c` \u2013 A unique identifier for the SSH client used in the connection attempts.\n\n3. **SSH Client Version**: `SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.8.2` \u2013 The specific SSH client library version used during the attack.\n\n4. **Destination Port**: `2222` \u2013 The port targeted by the attack, which may indicate an attempt to exploit a service running on this non-standard SSH port.\n\n5. **Reconnaissance Commands**: The particular commands used (`uname -a`, `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, `free -m`, `dmidecode|grep Vendor|head -n 1`, `ps -x`, `dmesg | grep irtual`) serve as IOCs, indicating an attacker attempting to profile the system.\n\n6. **Connection Patterns**: The repeated and systematic connection attempts to the same destination IP and port can represent an IOC, suggesting a targeted approach.\n\n7. **Blocked or Alerted Attempts**: Interactions from the source IP that were flagged or blocked by security devices or services, as indicated in threat intelligence reports.\n\n8. **Threat Intelligence Listings**: Appearance of the source IP in threat intelligence blocklists such as blocklist.de, dataplane.org, and those reported by CyberGordon's data sources.\n\nRemember, IOCs can evolve as attackers adapt their techniques, so effective security requires continuous monitoring, updating threat intelligence sources, and refining security measures as new evidence emerges. The IOCs listed here are specific to the attack details that have been provided."}
