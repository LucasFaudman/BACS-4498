{"Breifly describe the attack.": "The attack involved two source IP addresses `218.92.0.60` and `43.198.99.93` targeting a single destination IP `172.31.5.68`. The attacker was able to successfully authenticate using four different login username and password combinations: \n\n- `root` with `admin123`\n- `root` with `root`\n- `root` with `password`\n- `root` with `user`\n\nOnce access was gained, the attacker executed a series of commands that included:\n\n1. An attempt to execute a suspicious file: `/bin/eyshcjdmzg`\n2. A shell script that:\n   - Downloads files named `112` and `112s` from `http://43.249.172.195:888/`.\n   - Attempts to use both `wget` and `curl` to download these files, suggesting a persistence effort.\n   - Changes the permissions of the downloaded files to make them executable.\n   - Executes the downloaded files.\n   - Attempts to remove the `112` and `112s` files, along with the script `112.sh`.\n   - Clears the command `history` presumably to cover tracks.\n3. Checked for the existence of a file at the path: `/var/run/gcc.pid`.\n\nBased on the commands, the attack seems to be aimed at establishing persistence and possibly part of a larger botnet activity or other forms of malicious activities. The downloaded files are likely to be some form of malware or scripts facilitating the attack."}
