{"Explain what the SSH data shows in the context of the attack.": "The SSH data obtained from the Shodan scan of the source IPs involved in the attack reveals details about the SSH services running on the open ports of these IPs. Here's an analysis in the context of the attack:\n\n### `218.92.0.60` (China - Nanjing):\n- **Port 1080** is running **OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.10**. While this information does not directly relate to the actions performed against the honeypot, it suggests that the IP might be associated with a compromised system running an older version of Ubuntu and OpenSSH. This system might be a part of a botnet or used for other malicious purposes.\n\n### `43.198.99.93` (Amazon EC2 - Hong Kong):\n- **Port 22** is running **OpenSSH 8.0**. This OpenSSH version is likely the one utilized by the attacker while interacting with the honeypot. The fact that this IP is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance in Hong Kong might indicate that the attacker is using a compromised cloud resource to carry out the attack. It's a common tactic of attackers to use cloud-based infrastructure to mask their true location and distribute their attack sources.\n- Additional services running on **Port 80 (nginx 1.24.0)** and **Port 3306 (MySQL 8.0.20)** are identified, which indicates that this IP could be hosting web-based services or a database. These services themselves could potentially be vectors for exploitation or indicate the nature of the compromised host.\n\nIn the context of the attack, the details about the SSH services do not provide direct insight into the attack mechanisms, except that Port 22 on `43.198.99.93` is typically used for SSH communications, and it is reasonable to assume that if the machine were compromised, the attacker could use it as a jump point for further attacks, including the one on the honeypot. The fact that the honeypot was targeted on Port 2222 (a non-default SSH port) can be seen as an evasion technique to avoid detection, as attackers may assume that non-standard ports might not be monitored as closely as the default SSH port (22).\n\nOverall, the information urges an investigation into the security posture of the source IPs and potentially indicates compromised hosts used in the botnet that performed the attack."}
