{"Summarize what is known about the IP addresses involved in the attack using ThreatFox.": "The ThreatFox data indicates that there is no reported information or indicators of compromise (IoCs) linked specifically to the IP addresses `218.92.0.60` and `43.198.99.93` within its threat intelligence database. This means that, as per ThreatFox\u2019s data, these IPs are not currently recognized as sources of specific malware or malicious campaigns, or else they have not yet been reported and cataloged in the ThreatFox database. \n\nDespite the absence of data in ThreatFox, practices of threat intelligence and security defenses should consider that the lack of data does not imply the absence of threat. The insights from other sources, such as ISC and Shodan, demonstrate a history of malicious activity associated with these IP addresses."}
