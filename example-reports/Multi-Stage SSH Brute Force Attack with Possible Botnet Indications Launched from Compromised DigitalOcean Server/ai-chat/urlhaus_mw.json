    "content": "what does urlhaus show about the malware source?",
    "answer": "URLhaus provides valuable information about the source IP `213.255.246.81` which was used in this attack to serve malware.\n\nA total of 10 URLs were found associated with this IP, most of which are variants of the `fuckjewishpeople` script for different architectures. All of these URLs are now offline and no longer serving a payload.\n\nHere are some noteworthy points from the data:\n\n- The scripts served from this IP are associated with well-known malware families such as `elf.mirai` and `elf.bashlite`.\n\n- The script names also indicate specific targeted architectures like `x86`, `arm6`, `sparc`, `mpsl`, `mips`, `arm4`, `arm5`, `arm7` and `ppc`.\n\n- Each script was reported to the hosting provider, which likely contributed to taking them down.\n\nWhile the `fuckjewishpeople.sh` file name is disturbing, it is important to note that these scripts' purpose was to serve known malware, performing malicious activities ranging from botnet creation to DDoS attacks. Their naming might have been chosen deliberately to shock or deflect attention, but their primary objective was malicious activity against machines/networks.\n\nResearching and categorising the nature of the URLs and scripts hosted at the IP `213.255.246.81`, it is evident the attacker was actively engaged in serving a range of malicious scripts targeting different machine architectures, hinting at a broad-spectrum attack to gain as many infected hosts as possible.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80.
