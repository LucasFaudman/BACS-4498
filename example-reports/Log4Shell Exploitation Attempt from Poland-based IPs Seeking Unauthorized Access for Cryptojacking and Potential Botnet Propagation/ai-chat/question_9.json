    "answer": "[XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) is an open-source software project that is completely legitimate in its intended use. It provides code to mine Monero, a popular cryptocurrency, using system resources, specifically the CPU. Similar to many other open-source projects, it is designed and intended for use by the system owner.\n\nHowever, this software is often misused by cybercriminals, who infiltrate systems and install XMRig without the user's consent. This kind of illegitimate use falls under a practice known as \"bundling\". Unauthorized installation of such applications not only exploits CPU resources for mining cryptocurrency but can also result in an overall sluggish system, and might degrade hardware due to the intensive tasks.\n\nMoreover, the bundled applications accompanying XMRig are often Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) that can display intrusive advertisements and may also contain spyware functionalities to track and gather sensitive user information.\n\nIt is essential to note that the illegitimate use of XMRig, in this case, reflects the misdemeanor of the attackers and not a flaw in the XMRig software itself.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 22: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0) Port 23: Cowrie Telnet server Port 8000: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
