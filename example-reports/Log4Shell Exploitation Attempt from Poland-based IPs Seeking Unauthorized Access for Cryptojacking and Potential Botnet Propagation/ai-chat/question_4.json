    "answer": "The `TomcatBypass` part of the HTTP requests suggests that the attacker may have been attempting to exploit a vulnerability related to Apache Tomcat. However, after searching the ExploitDB for \"TomcatBypass\", no specific exploit match was found.\n\nThis could indicate that the exploit is not listed in ExploitDB, or it could be a custom or lesser-known technique used by the attacker to bypass security measures in Apache Tomcat. Given the absence of a match in ExploitDB, we might need to investigate other OSINT sources, analyze the behavior of the payloads, or look at any known vulnerabilities or advisories related to Apache Tomcat that describe a bypass mechanism.\n\nApache Tomcat has had several vulnerabilities over the years which attackers frequently target due to its widespread usage. An attacker with the ability to bypass Tomcat security mechanisms could potentially execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or compromise the server.\n\nIf further investigation is needed, we could look at vulnerability databases, mailing lists, or forums where exploits and security issues are discussed to find more information on this potential \"TomcatBypass\" exploit.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 8000: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
