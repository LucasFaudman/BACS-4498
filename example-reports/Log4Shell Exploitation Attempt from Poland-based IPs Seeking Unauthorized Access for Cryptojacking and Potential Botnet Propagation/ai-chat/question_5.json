    "answer": "I attempted to search ExploitDB using the term \"jndi ldap\" which is associated with Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) LDAP injection attacks, but no specific exploit matches were found in the ExploitDB database. This again suggests that the exploit being attempted by the attacker may not be listed in this particular database, or may not be identified using the provided search terms.\n\nSince searches for \"TomcatBypass\" and \"jndi ldap\" did not return any results, we may be looking for an exploit that is not documented in ExploitDB. It's also possible that the attacker used a known vulnerability in a novel way that is not explicitly described in known exploit databases. \n\nGiven the connection to Tomcat and the use of JNDI LDAP strings in the HTTP requests, this could indicate that the attacker was attempting a Log4Shell-like or related exploitation technique, which leverages JNDI LDAP lookups to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. If this is the case, the actual exploit may be a variation or a customization of known exploits that target JNDI LDAP injection vulnerabilities.\n\nTo investigate further, we would need to explore other sources, such as CVE databases, security advisories, or other OSINT tools that track and report on known vulnerabilities and exploits.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 8000: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
