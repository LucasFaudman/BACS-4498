    "answer": "The Log4Shell vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-44228, involving the Apache Log4j 2 RCE (Remote Code Execution), was discovered and disclosed in December 2021. Therefore, as of my knowledge cutoff date in April 2023, this technique is approximately 1 year and 4 months old. It is a relatively new technique in the cybersecurity landscape, and it garnered significant attention due to the widespread usage of the Log4j logging library across numerous Java-based applications, making the impact of the vulnerability quite vast.\n\nAfter its discovery, the vulnerability was given the highest severity score due to its potential for widespread exploitation and impact, prompting quick patch releases and remediation efforts across the industry. Attacks leveraging this vulnerability could use specially crafted LDAP queries via JNDI to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers, leading to significant security incidents if left unaddressed.\n\nHowever, while the exploit itself is not new, attackers may continue to use it, along with variations of the technique, especially against systems that have not been updated with the necessary patches to remediate the vulnerability.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 8000: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
