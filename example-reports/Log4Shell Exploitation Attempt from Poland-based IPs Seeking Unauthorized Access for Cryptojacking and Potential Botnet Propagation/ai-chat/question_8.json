    "answer": "The OSINT data from ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar, and URLhaus regarding the IP addresses found in the HTTP requests and decoded arguments reveals the following information about malware:\n\n**IP Address: 174.138.82.190**\n- **ThreatFox**: No specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) or reports associated with this IP.\n- **MalwareBazaar**: No malware associated with this IP.\n- **URLhaus**: No information about malware related to this IP.\n\n**IP Address: 141.147.79.97**\n- **ThreatFox**: No specific IOCs or reports associated with this IP.\n- **MalwareBazaar**: No malware associated with this IP.\n- **URLhaus**: No information about malware related to this IP.\n\n**IP Address: 141.147.74.15**\n- **ThreatFox**: No specific IOCs or reports associated with this IP.\n- **MalwareBazaar**: No malware associated with this IP.\n- **URLhaus**: Listed with malware being served from the host. The host is reported to be online and serving payloads associated with malicious downloads. The IP has been linked to several URLs serving malware related to the Mirai botnet, specifically ELF variants for different architectures such as ARM, PowerPC, and x86. Tags include \"32\", \"elf\", \"mirai\", \"renesas\", \"arm\", and \"PowerPC\". The malware is identified with the malpedia name \"elf.mirai\". All URLs have been reported to the hosting provider.\n\nRegarding IP 141.147.74.15, URLhaus has reported multiple URLs active on this host that currently serve payloads identified as Mirai, a well-known IoT botnet that can be used to facilitate large-scale network attacks, such as DDoS. This suggests that this IP address is part of a malicious infrastructure used to distribute malware, and in this case, it's distributing versions of the Mirai botnet across different processor architectures.\n\nThese findings underscore the malware distribution aspect of the attack and the reliance on host 141.147.74.15 as a dissemination point for the Mirai botnet. It is likely that the attacker attempted to use the honeypot to further propagate Mirai by downloading and executing malware from this host.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 8000: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
