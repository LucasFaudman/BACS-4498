    "content": "whats going on with the request that has ohhellohttpserver?",
    "answer": "It seems that there are no specific exploits related to the \"ohhellohttpserver\" in the ExploitDB database. This indicates that there may not be a known exploit or vulnerability specifically associated with the \"ohhellohttpserver\" based on the available exploit database information.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 80: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
