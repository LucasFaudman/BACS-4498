    "answer": "The attacker is using the encoded commands to perform malicious activities in a secret or hidden manner. Specifically, the attacker is leveraging encoding to obfuscate their commands to avoid detection by simple security measures, like keyword or string pattern detection.\n\nLooking at the provided HTTP requests, the encoded commands seem to perform the following actions:\n\n1. **Create Directories and Download Files**:\nIn the initial steps, the attacker uses commands to make a directory in the `/tmp/` folder and then downloads files from the attacker-controlled server. The downloaded files are likely malicious payloads or scripts used to further exploit the compromised system.\n\n2. **Invoke Remote Server**:\nThe attacker then directs the compromised system to connect with their server. This provides the attacker with remote access control of the victim's system, which can be used for various malicious activities like data exfiltration or further system exploitation.\n\n3. **Execute Downloaded Files:**\nOnce the files are downloaded, the attacker executes these files. This could lead to various outcomes like the installation of a backdoor, initiation of a botnet, cryptocurrency mining, or simply providing the attacker with elevated privileges on the victim's system.\n\nIn general, the attacker's use of encoded commands allows them to conceal their actions, making their intrusion more difficult to detect and, hence, making their attempts to compromise the system more likely to succeed.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 80: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
