    "content": "what is zmap used for in the malware?",
    "answer": "In the malware, `zmap` is used as a fast network scanning tool specifically to identify and catalog hosts on the internet that have port 22 open, which is typically used for SSH (Secure Shell) services. The snippets of code in the malware that pertain to `zmap` use indicate the following actions:\n\n1. Scans port 22 at a vast scale to find potential SSH servers: `zmap -p 22 (...)`\n\n2. Outputs the results to a file: `zmap -p 22 -o $FILE -n 100000`\n\n3. Uses the list of IPs found to attempt to replicate itself onto these new targets using `sshpass` to provide the password non-interactively and `scp` to copy the malware file: `sshpass -praspberry scp (...) && sshpass -praspberry ssh (...)`\n\n4. Executes the malware on any newly compromised machines in hopes of further propagating the infection: `cd /tmp && chmod +x $NAME && bash -c ./$NAME`\n\nThe use of `zmap` in the malware is indicative of the attacker's intent to conduct a widespread search for vulnerable systems that can be compromised through SSH brute force attacks. By scanning for open SSH ports, the malware creator is aiming for lateral movement across the internet to spread the infection to as many devices as possible, potentially enlarging a botnet or creating a large pool of compromised systems for various malicious purposes.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 22: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0) Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
