> `Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.`

## Prompt: What do we know about the ips and urls found in the malware? 

**Run ID:** `run_tmBMj3fwLVPNhob8tg0fOxpo`

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

Based on the analysis conducted earlier, here's what we know about the IPs and URLs found in the malware:

### Malware-Related IPs and URLs:
- No specific URLs were associated with the malware based on the analysed attributes.
- The malware was downloaded during sessions initiated from the following source IPs:
  - `93.223.169.159`
  - `27.93.25.111`
  - `111.216.194.148`
  
### Analysis of Malware-related IPs:
- The three source IPs have been linked to malicious activities across various OSINT sources. They were reported for suspicious behaviors such as SSH brute force attacks and potential involvement in coordinated botnet activities.
- There have been reports and listings on blocklists and threat intelligence feeds such as AbuseIPDB, Shodan, ISC, CyberGordon, and others, indicating a history of malicious conduct.
- The IPs are associated with internet service providers in Germany and Japan and exhibited patterns that suggest they are part of an attack infrastructure.

### The Absence of URLs in the Malware:
- The data obtained did not reveal any URLs embedded within the malware itself. Therefore, there are no indicators that would point towards a specific domain or web infrastructure used for command and control or further distribution of the malware.

In conclusion, while there is substantive data regarding the nature and potential origins of the attacking IP addresses, there is no information within the provided malware sample related to URLs, which might correspond to command and control servers, download sites for additional payloads, or other malicious online infrastructure.

The malware sample analyzed did not contain any embedded hosts within its source code. Therefore, there were no specific hostnames or domain names extracted from the malware that could provide additional context or leads on the network infrastructure used for command and control or further malware distribution. This lack of embedded hosts might suggest that the malware relies on other means to communicate with its operators or to spread, such as hard-coded IP addresses, external configuration files, or a decentralized approach like a peer-to-peer network.

## Prompt: look at the source code to be sure

**Run ID:** `run_b026ZYVrywAWc1QDEqs8XhlJ`

<h3>Answer</h3>

Certainly! Let's take a closer look at the text from the malware source code to examine if there are any hosts or domain names present.

From the earlier provided snippet of the malware source code, I noticed that there were entries related to modifying the `/etc/hosts` file and several hardcoded server addresses within an IRC botnet setup. The specific line from the source code is as follows:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu" >> /etc/hosts
```

- The domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` was being redirected to the localhost address (`127.0.0.1`), which is often a technique used to block the domain by preventing the system from reaching the actual host associated with it.

As for the IRC servers, the malware code includes an array of hardcoded IRC server addresses which were part of a botnet functionality:

```bash
    arr[0]="ix1.undernet.org"
    arr[1]="ix2.undernet.org"
    arr[2]="Ashburn.Va.Us.UnderNet.org"
    arr[3]="Bucharest.RO.EU.Undernet.Org"
    arr[4]="Budapest.HU.EU.UnderNet.org"
    arr[5]="Chicago.IL.US.Undernet.org"
```

These entries are used by the botnet component of the malware to connect to these servers for command and control communication. The inclusion of multiple server addresses likely serves as a redundancy mechanism to maintain connectivity to the C2 infrastructure even if one or more servers are unavailable.

Both the redirection of the domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` to the loopback address and the hardcoded Undernet IRC server hostnames are critical in understanding the behavior and potential infrastructure of the malware.

| `Chicago.IL.US.Undernet.org` | `{'threatfox': '', 'urlhaus': ''}` |

<h3>Answer</h3>
</summary>

The OSINT sources queried, ThreatFox and URLhaus, did not return any data for the domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` or the IRC server hostnames:

- `ix1.undernet.org`
- `ix2.undernet.org`
- `Ashburn.Va.Us.UnderNet.org`
- `Bucharest.RO.EU.Undernet.Org`
- `Budapest.HU.EU.UnderNet.org`
- `Chicago.IL.US.Undernet.org`

This lack of information suggests that either these domains are not recognized as part of any known threat intelligence feeds in ThreatFox and URLhaus, or they have not been reported or cataloged in relation to malicious activities in these databases.

It could be that the domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` is an internal indicator within the attacker's infrastructure or part of a less widespread campaign that hasn't been broadly detected. The Undernet IRC servers are legitimate servers likely used by the malware for command and control; their legitimate nature may explain the lack of listings in threat intelligence feeds that typically focus on malicious domains.
