    "content": "Are the source IPs associated with any other malware samples?",
    "answer": "The CyberGordon data does not explicitly link the source IPs to any other specific malware samples by naming them. However, these IPs have been associated with several indicators of malicious activities, including:\n\n### IP: 93.223.169.159\n- Identified as a point of origin for malicious/attacker activity and abuse/bot activity.\n- Listed on multiple blocklists, including those by Charles Haley, DataPlane.org, James Brine, and Scriptz Team.\n- Found in 28 attacks and has 22 reports on BlackList DE.\n- Recognized for SSH brute force activity on Pulsedive.\n- Recorded in 502 reports by 216 users on AbuseIPDB.\n\n### IP: 27.93.25.111\n- Reported in 64 attacks and has 29 reports on BlackList DE.\n- Categorized as part of EU Botnets/Zombies/Scanners in offline feeds.\n- High-risk status on webroot.com and blocklists such as Anti-attacks.com and Charles Haley.\n- Recorded in 1053 reports by 376 users on AbuseIPDB.\n\n### IP: 111.216.194.148\n- Found in 28 attacks and has 17 reports on BlackList DE.\n- Part of EU Botnets/Zombies/Scanners as mentioned in offline feeds.\n- High-risk status on webroot.com and listed on blocklists such as Anti-attacks.com and James Brine.\n- Recorded in 460 reports by 210 users on AbuseIPDB.\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence linking these IPs to other specific malware samples, their widespread association with malicious activity and various security incidents suggests they are part of broader attack campaigns and could be part of the infrastructure used to launch attacks and manage malware operations. It is not uncommon for such IPs to be multipurposed across different types of malware and various attack strategies.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 22: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0) Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
