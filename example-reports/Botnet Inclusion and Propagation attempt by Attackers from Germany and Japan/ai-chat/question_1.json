    "answer": "Based on the analysis conducted earlier, here's what we know about the IPs and URLs found in the malware:\n\n### Malware-Related IPs and URLs:\n- No specific URLs were associated with the malware based on the analysed attributes.\n- The malware was downloaded during sessions initiated from the following source IPs:\n  - `93.223.169.159`\n  - `27.93.25.111`\n  - `111.216.194.148`\n  \n### Analysis of Malware-related IPs:\n- The three source IPs have been linked to malicious activities across various OSINT sources. They were reported for suspicious behaviors such as SSH brute force attacks and potential involvement in coordinated botnet activities.\n- There have been reports and listings on blocklists and threat intelligence feeds such as AbuseIPDB, Shodan, ISC, CyberGordon, and others, indicating a history of malicious conduct.\n- The IPs are associated with internet service providers in Germany and Japan and exhibited patterns that suggest they are part of an attack infrastructure.\n\n### The Absence of URLs in the Malware:\n- The data obtained did not reveal any URLs embedded within the malware itself. Therefore, there are no indicators that would point towards a specific domain or web infrastructure used for command and control or further distribution of the malware.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is substantive data regarding the nature and potential origins of the attacking IP addresses, there is no information within the provided malware sample related to URLs, which might correspond to command and control servers, download sites for additional payloads, or other malicious online infrastructure.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
