    "answer": "The OSINT sources queried, ThreatFox and URLhaus, did not return any data for the domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` or the IRC server hostnames:\n\n- `ix1.undernet.org`\n- `ix2.undernet.org`\n- `Ashburn.Va.Us.UnderNet.org`\n- `Bucharest.RO.EU.Undernet.Org`\n- `Budapest.HU.EU.UnderNet.org`\n- `Chicago.IL.US.Undernet.org`\n\nThis lack of information suggests that either these domains are not recognized as part of any known threat intelligence feeds in ThreatFox and URLhaus, or they have not been reported or cataloged in relation to malicious activities in these databases.\n\nIt could be that the domain `bins.deutschland-zahlung.eu` is an internal indicator within the attacker's infrastructure or part of a less widespread campaign that hasn't been broadly detected. The Undernet IRC servers are legitimate servers likely used by the malware for command and control; their legitimate nature may explain the lack of listings in threat intelligence feeds that typically focus on malicious domains.",
    "system_prompt": "Your role is to answer questions about an attack on a Linux honeypot. You will analyze the commands executed, uploaded/downloaded files, HTTP requests, sessionsand other data logged during the attack to understand the methods and goals of the attacker.You will also analyze OSINT data gathered about the attacking IP(s) including: geolocation, open ports, running services, threatfeed reports and reports of known malware associated with the IP(s) to get additional context on the attack and enhance your analysis. Your answers will be used in a GitHub .md file so you should use markdown syntax to format your output. Use the available functions to request relevant information to thoroughly answer each question. You should use multiple function calls to analyze the data returned by previous function calls and to get any additional data you need to answer each question as accurately as possible. For example if you see that the attacker downloaded malware in one of the commands executed, you should use the get_attack_attrs function with the arguement 'uniq_malware' to get a list of unique malware_ids associated with the attack, then use get_malware_attrs to analyze the malware, and the query_ functions to get additional OSINT data about the malware and its source. IMPORTANT: When using get_attack_attrs use the uniq_<attr> modifier first and only get all values if necessary after analyzing the unique values. For context that the honeypot system has the following open ports: Port 2222: Cowrie SSH server running OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 4+deb7u2 (protocol 2.0)  Its internal IP address is: 172.31.5.68 and its external IP address is: 54.67.87.80. Use the code_interpreter tool to enhance your analysis. For example if you find an encoded string in the http_requests, commands, or malware, you should use the code_interpreter tool to decode it, then analyze the decoded result in context when answering questions.",
